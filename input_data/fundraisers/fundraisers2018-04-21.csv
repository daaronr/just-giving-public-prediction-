Then comes Shiloh the bush kid from Winton QLD, home of waltzing Matilda and one of the worlds biggest dinosaurs. If he's not watching the Cowboys play he can be found out building humpies or telling yarns to whoever will listen. <br />Last but not least is Morgan the young pup still wet behind the ears. He hails from Charleville QLD another bush kid. His hobbies include watching and playing any sport with a ball, and kicking some dirt up on the dance floors at some country shindigs!! <br />We are looking to get our page out there for everyone to see.

This is a 10,000 mile trip from London to Mongolia with the finish line in a town called Ulan Ude just North of the Mongolian border. This Mammoth road trip has to be completed in a car that is 1L or less with no off-road adaptations to make the journey easier. The trip will be a challenging but EPIC adventure across deserts, mountain ranges and into totally unfamiliar lands.</p><p>We have chosen to do this trip in support of the Cool Earth. This is the official Mongol Rally charity that works with local communities to save the worlds most at risk rainforests. With the size of rainforests globally decreasing rapidly this is a very worthwhile charity to support. They have already saved areas of rainforest by working closely with the people who live in them which is a new strategy that is proving majorly successful. </p><p>Please help us raise money for this worthwhile charity by donating.

<p>My name is Tino. I'm going to be 4 on the 24th May. I love presents but I love animals even more. Especially those living in the rainforest. My favourite animals are the Hyacinth Macaw and the Toco Toucan.  But I love so many - the Andean cock-of-the rock, the emerald tree boa, jaguars, anacondas, hornbills, ring-tailed lemurs and fossas to name just a few.  I've seen many of them in the zoo, but one day I would like to see them in the wild, in the rainforest. </p>
<p>We have a book in school, called The Rainforest. It has all my favourite animals, but it also tells about how people are cutting more and more trees in the rainforest and the animals are losing their home. Without a home, the animals will disappear. Will the rainforest be there when I'm grown up? Will I be able to see the macaws and all the other rainforest animals? I hope so...</p>
<p>I'm small still but I want to help the rainforest. I'm having a party for my birthday and have invited my friends. There are always many presents at birthdays. I'm fortunate enough that I will have lots of lovely presents from my family. So I'm asking my friends, instead of giving me presents, to help me help the rainforest.</p>
<p>Cool Earth is a charity that works with local communities to protect the rainforest from being cut down. This impacts many things like climate change, local community welfare, and biodiversity which I hope to understand better as I grow up. However, what I do understand now, is that it helps save the habitat of the rainforest animals. So please, help me help them.</p>

Each year, they publish a list of their top-rated charities.</span></p><p>On this list was Malaria Consortium, a world leading non-profit organisations specialising in the prevention, control and treatment of malaria and other communicable diseases among vulnerable populations.</p><p>Current statistics from the World Health Organisation estimate that 445,000 people die as consequence of malaria each year. In 2015, 303,000 children died before their firth birthday. It is estimated that malaria kills one child dies every minute. I find these horrifying statistics incomprehensible in this day and age but unfortunately, they are accurate. There is strong evidence that seasonal malaria chemoprevention provided by the Malaria Consortium substantially reduces cases of malaria.</p><p>Please help me to raise some money for this incredibly worthy cause.</p><p>Thank you very much</p><p>Issa</p><p>If you would like further information, please visit:</p><p><a href=""https://www.givewell.org/charities/malaria-consortium"">https://www.givewell.org/charities/malaria-consortium</a></p><p><a href=""http://www.malariaconsortium.org"">http://www.malariaconsortium.org</a></p><p><a href=""http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs094/en/"">http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs094/en/</a></p><p><a href=""http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/malaria/en/"">http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/malaria/en/</a></p>",Issa runs Paris Marathon to help Malaria Consortium,122.50,0,627.94,314,0,https://images.justgiving.com/image/470fc057-cd9d-4562-8c5f-8761fc3a5c73.jpg,https://images.justgiving.com/image/470fc057-cd9d-4562-8c5f-8761fc3a5c73.jpg?template=size150x150face,Paris Marathon because nearly half of the world's population is at risk,Paris Marathon,nearly half of the world's population is at risk,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Paris Marathon 2018,http://www.justgiving.com/Issa-Salem,/Issa-Salem,United Kingdom,...Issa runs Paris Marathon to help <strong>Malaria</strong> <strong>Consortium</strong>...,Issa runs Paris Marathon to help Malaria Consortium,//images.justgiving.com/image/626e0214-a325-4d3f-9dc5-dba449c72b3e.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,29.331888,Issa Salem,2018-03-15T20:34:50,181721,4193387,2018-04-08T00:00:00,200,183804,Paris Marathon,nearly half of the world's population is at risk,Malaria Consortium,181721,2018-04-21T19:37:33Z

Anyway, I shaved my head in the heat of the moment with some pals on New Year's Eve and had no chance to set up this page. The charity I have chosen to try and raise some funds for is Malaria Consortium. A charity which is doing fantastic work into trying to diminish to devastating impact that malaria is having across Africa at present day. Being a non-profit organisation, the charity makes use of all proceeds. If you would like anymore information about what the charity does then google is your best mate.

We target key health burdens, including malaria, pneumonia, dengue and neglected tropical diseases, along with other factors that impact child and maternal health.<br/></p>",Bicycles for community health workers in Uganda,18.75,20,225.74,123,0,https://images.justgiving.com/image/c7010621-5008-4e1d-b245-831ab400d735.jpg,https://images.justgiving.com/image/c7010621-5008-4e1d-b245-831ab400d735.jpg?template=size150x150face,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Bicycles for community health workers in Uganda,http://www.justgiving.com/Portia-Reyes,/Portia-Reyes,United Kingdom,...<strong>Malaria</strong> <strong>Consortium</strong>...,Bicycles for community health workers in Uganda,//images.justgiving.com/image/facdc923-fe87-4ef7-bba2-03ec2c9bd9d4.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,2.9979591,Portia Reyes,2016-11-19T21:26:10,181721,3962771,2016-11-19T21:26:10,200,3728688,NA,NA,Malaria Consortium,181721,2018-04-21T19:37:33Z

I have read and reviewed all the information carefully, and I am still proud to be running the marathon for Oxfam UK.<br/><br/>Here are my reasons:<br/><br/>1)    It won’t be Oxfam which suffers from fundraising cuts it will be the people most vulnerable caught in crisis<br/><br/>2)    Oxfam is in a unique position to shape the future of the Aid industry and stamp out abuse<br/><br/>Oxfam is one of the largest most recognised charities in the world, it is now in the spotlight and will continue to be in the spotlight. By continuing to support Oxfam, we can push Oxfam to set a gold standard in safe guarding, and best practices in vulnerable situations to ensure this never happens again. We don’t need Oxfam just for the charity it can give, we need Oxfam for it’s unique position it now finds itself in to drive real change.<br/><br/>3)    The horrendous actions of the minority shouldn’t punish the good work of the majority<br/><br/>9 people have been accused of sexual misconduct out of a global organisation of 10,000 employees. The rest of these 10,000 people are just as shocked as we are.

So, this is my way to be the part of making others living their best life in this world. My goal is to raise as much as possible for the charity drive by raising my service standards to the best quality as possible.</span><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><b>What inspires me to do the charity drive</b> is by looking inspiring from big entrepreneurs out there giving away their life and money to help others. Bill Gates is one of the people I am inspired by, whom donated most of his wealth for charity reasons around the globe. I do realize that I’m not that so called a big company to donate most of my wealth to charity. But I believe that with every small step I’ve made, I could make a difference in someone’s life. <br/><br/>I chose Oxfam as my charity platform because they are doing a great job on giving aids to the needs out there in all around the world. Oxfam is a movement of millions of people, all working towards one goal – an end to poverty for everyone. I believe on what they believed, “In a world rich in resources, poverty isn’t inevitable.” I feel that I’m not the one whom need the most from the resources, so I think I should give my part to someone who need it the most. Oxfam believe that everyone should be able to eat, drink, earn and learn as much as we do. </div><div><br/>T<b>hrough Oxfam and their partners, 4.3 million people got access to clean water, 2 million people got food, cash or vouchers to survive a crisis, and 1.7 million women were supported to exercise their rights. </b>They couldn't have done it without someone like us. </div><div><br/>On average for every £1 donated to Oxfam, they invest 84p on their humanitarian, development and campaigning work. They invest 8p to raise further funds, and they invest 8p on support and running costs such as paying the salaries of staff who work all year round to deliver their work and who ensure they are effective and accountable.</div><div><br/>To conclude and to mention it again, the idea behind the charity drive is to cut off 20% from every income I’ve received from my graphic design service and donating them to charity. So, obviously, the more I get, the more I will give in return and more people I could contribute to. This is my goal. All donation will go straight to my profile at JustGiving.com and will be donated to Oxfam. </div><div><br/>Thank you for all you support!</div><div><br/>Regards,</div><div>Azri Omar<br/><p><span> </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span></span></p><p></p></div>",Ahmad Azri's Charity for Oxfam,0,0,0,0,0,https://images.justgiving.com/image/c5542eaf-6cc7-4391-a315-8877d1c36f21.jpg,https://images.justgiving.com/image/c5542eaf-6cc7-4391-a315-8877d1c36f21.jpg?template=size150x150face,I am raising money because I believe everyone deserves equal benefits.,I am raising money,I believe everyone deserves equal benefits.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Charity for Oxfam,http://www.justgiving.com/Azri-Omar,/Azri-Omar,United Kingdom,...Ahmad Azri's Charity for <strong>Oxfam</strong>...,Ahmad Azri's Charity for Oxfam,//images.justgiving.com/image/36eaf3af-c3b7-4dfa-984d-f5af9531aaae.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,8.465003,Ahmad Azri Omar,2015-12-08T19:35:41,13441,3129090,2015-12-08T19:35:41,500,15524,I am raising money,I believe everyone deserves equal benefits.,Oxfam,13441,2018-04-21T19:37:33Z

We are a team of four women who are willing to undertake the endurance of the 100K Oxfam TrailWalker Challenge through the South Downs from the Queen Elizabeth County Park in Hampshire, starting at 6am on the 14 July to trek day and night non-stop until we reach Brighton! The event is timed and we plan to finish in sub-24 hours so we can be in Brighton for breakfast! </p><p>This will be the ultimate challenge for our team as we have never undergone an ultra before! Made up of runners, hikers, trailwalkers and cyclists, though our outdoor activity styles are different we all share a love of a challenge and a passion for life. This challenge will definitely be our toughest to date but we are excited to be part of it and work to become Trailwalker Legends!! To hike, walk and run solid for 24 hours will test us to our limits of mental and physical strength. The route was set by The Gurka Signals over 30 years ago as the ultimate test of teamwork and endurance for new recruits with a total ascent of 2,500m - the equivalent of Ben Nevis and Snowdonia combined - this will be no walk in the park. To achieve this challenge we will be training for months to make sure we are Trailwalker fit and to make you all an Oxfam proud!</p><p>For more information about the challenge check out Oxfam's website https://www.oxfam.org.uk/Trailwalker. We aim to raise a minumum of £1400 which will p<span style=""color: rgb(84, 84, 84);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);float: none;"">rovide live-saving hygiene kits to protect 241 parents and children in Niger from waterbourne disease. Kits include water purification tablets, safe water storage, cups and soap. £1650 would provide safe drinking water for 1,650 people.

They urgently need help from people like us to be able to offer assistance to more people and prevent the crisis from turning into a catastrophe.</p><p>We chose this project to work on as South Sudan is something of an unseen crisis, which isn't usually prominent in the media, and which many people in our school and the wider community may never have heard of before. As such, we set up a 'mock refugee camp' at our school one lunchtime to raise awareness amongst the student body.</p><p>We will be camping for the night at school, and would massively appreciate any donations, however big or small, that you are able to give.

And will be even more central going forward.  The irony is that Oxfam is a rare organisation that tries to challenge the deep-rooted barriers women face, such as discriminatory attitudes and violence.  I've also seen how transparency feeds newspaper headlines: Oxfam has been reporting safeguarding claims in the annual report for some years already.  </p><p>Next time around, I will revert to raising funds for deafness or other causes outside of my day job, but this year is a time for solidarity with Oxfam and the people it is helping day by day.</p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

I really wanted a personal challenge, and after seeing a couple of my close friends and family members complete this incredible achievement it gave me the push to actually apply. Then I got a place coupled with an opportunity to raise some money for a great charity along the way. After a few weeks of panicking I've finally come to terms with the journey ahead and the amount I'm going to run .

I will be running with my wife Teresa...her first attempt as well! </p><p>This is a massive personal challenge and we decided we would like to raise £4000 (£2000 each) to help Oxfam fight poverty all over the world. I have seen poverty at first hand through my work in delivering leadership training programmes in countries including Sierra Leone, Ghana, Libya and Morocco. We are so lucky to have been born into families free of poverty and we want to help others who cannot take for granted the things we have had through our lives. Things like food, water, heat, clothes and safety are a daily struggle for millions around the world. Even here in the UK, families live in poverty.</p><p>So as I run and as I struggle to keep going to the finish, I will be driven to carry on by remembering the faces and the families that I have seen living in abject poverty in some parts of our world.</p><p>Please donate as much as you can and watch out for updates as we train and prepare for the big day. We will be holding a Silent Disco here in East Devon soon and will publish details once we have confirmed the date.</p><p>Thank you</p>",Every marathon starts with just one step... first marathon at 60!!,163.12,0,1078,54,0,https://images.justgiving.com/image/ba0fa3e7-24c8-4167-92cb-fd8509d96e36.jpg,https://images.justgiving.com/image/ba0fa3e7-24c8-4167-92cb-fd8509d96e36.jpg?template=size150x150face,I am running in this year's London Marathon 2018 because I want to help fight poverty around the world.,I am running in this year's London Marathon 2018,I want to help fight poverty around the world.,NA,Teresa Jarrold,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,London Marathon 2018,http://www.justgiving.com/Nick-Jarrold1,/Nick-Jarrold1,United Kingdom,...<strong>Oxfam</strong>...,Every marathon starts with just one step... first marathon at 60!!,//images.justgiving.com/image/d646c871-543e-49fd-ba6a-340f7a9e4021.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,2.831866,nick Jarrold,2018-01-01T18:33:30,13441,4111382,2018-04-22T00:00:00,2000,5759016,I am running in this year's London Marathon 2018,I want to help fight poverty around the world.,Oxfam,13441,2018-04-21T19:37:33Z

The Oxfam Trailwalker begins at Queen Elizabeth Country Park passes through stunning but challenging terrain of South Downs National Park and finishes at Brighton Racecourse.<br/><br/>Teams of four enter this event and have 30 hours to walk or run the 100 km trail, although our team is hoping to finish within 20 hours.  It’s very likely that we’ll walk through the night (with little or no sleep) until the end. The event raises vital funds for Oxfam and The Gurkha Welfare Trust. The Gurkha welfare trust is a charity that provides financial, medical and community aid to ex-Gurkha servicemen and their communities in Nepal.<br/><br/>My team &#34;GasPanic&#34; is hoping to raise funds to help some of the world’s poorest people. Our fundraising campaign will also enable Oxfam to respond immediately to emergencies around the world, as well as to fight poverty at its roots by campaigning  against injustice and empowering people with life-changing projects. <br/><br/>My Trailwalker team members and I will be going the distance and we hope that you can support us in this massive challenge. Please consider how you may be able to get behind us, either by donating us or sharing our journey with your contacts in social media.  If you would like to support us then please find more information about our goals and activities on this page and where to donate for this good cause.<br/><br/>100 km is a long way to walk!  But putting ourselves through months of intense training will be worth it for the impact our fundraising has on others through Oxfam &amp; The Gurkha Welfare trust. Your support is what will take me and my teammates over that finish line.<br/><br/>We ask you to please give generously and consider that your donation will make a real difference. <br/><br/>Thank you!<br/><br/>Sushant<br/><br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Thanks for taking the time to visit my JustGiving page.<br/><br/>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

Why are we in this world or what our true purpose is? Past year or so I have struggled with an existential crisis and truth be told I am still not sure where I stand. But one thing I do know, there are people out there who are struggling just to survive and every one of us has a responsibility to help make a difference.<br/>Running in the London Marathon has been a dream and bucket list item for a very long time. Getting the opportunity to finally take part and that to, on behalf of Oxfam has made it even special. Not only am I able to experience and take part in such a prestigious event but I will also have the chance to truly help the people who need our support.<br/>Oxfam is one of the leading UK charities fighting global poverty. It is a globally renowned aid and development charity working and campaigning with partners in over 90 countries worldwide. One of my main reasons for choosing to support Oxfam was when I saw how extensively they were working in Bangladesh to help with the Rohingya Refugee Crisis. <br/>Over half a million Rohingya refugees have crossed over to Bangladesh since August and this unprecedented number arriving in a very short space of time has caused a large scale and escalating humanitarian crisis. Oxfam has responded by providing water tanks, water treatment plants and containers for clean drinking water; portable toilets and sanitation facilities; 70 tons of flattened rice, 23 tons of sugar, and 23,000 fortified biscuit packs; plastic sheets for shelter, and other essential supplies; dignity kits with hygiene items for women, girls, and children. They have already reached out to 180,000 people and the only way they can do more is with our support.<br/>Let us all do our bit and make a change! Come support me to reach my pledge of £2000 pounds which will go a long way in helping the people who are in desperate need of every penny that we can spare.<br/></p>",Aleef's London Marathon 2018 page,239,0,1402,70,0,https://images.justgiving.com/image/5bd65938-0ff9-474b-a9cd-b4f6d24bdfb2.jpg,https://images.justgiving.com/image/5bd65938-0ff9-474b-a9cd-b4f6d24bdfb2.jpg?template=size150x150face,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,London Marathon 2018,http://www.justgiving.com/Aleef7,/Aleef7,United Kingdom,...<strong>Oxfam</strong>...,Aleef's London Marathon 2018 page,//images.justgiving.com/image/trainer-no-branding_web.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true&sourcepath=Stock,Fundraiser,2.7519178,Aleef Hossain,2017-11-27T21:48:06,13441,4111382,2018-04-22T00:00:00,2000,5759016,NA,NA,Oxfam,13441,2018-04-21T19:37:33Z

The time limit is 30 hours, but last year my team of 3 completed in 22:06 despite the 10 hours of rain. This year, I want to do it better - better planning, better footwear, a bit more mentally prepared. About 12 hours in I did say that I would never do it again, that it was just a bit too much to push through, and then a blister popped and it was completely mind over matter. Somehow once you cool off and get some food and rest, you think, &#34;I know what to do differently&#34;, and so you sign up again. This year, Oxfam needs a show of support too.</p><p>I've been a strong supporter of Oxfam since I was a teenager campaigning on the Oxfam Youth Board, campaigning and stewarding at festivals, and volunteering in a shop. I donate monthly and didn't stop doing so even when the media went crazy. Obviously you don't want your money to be going towards work and campaigns that are lead by inconceivably horrific staff, but you cannot contest that productive, life-changing and critical work is being conducted by the other Oxfam staff. They work here in the UK as well, battling at the root cause to fight poverty and tackle economic inequality to make lives just a tad better for those trapped in a vicious cycle. I found last year when asking for sponsorship that my non-British friends didn't quite know who or what Oxfam is, and so weren't up for donating. Now they will know who Oxfam are, but not for the right reasons...<br/></p><p>While the money you donate will half go to Oxfam, the other half will go to the Gurkha Welfare Trust, a charity that helps support families of Gurkha veterans financially, medically and developmentally. The Gurkhas are Nepalese soldiers who were recruited in part by the British army due to their fearless attitude and sheer strength. The charity works in Nepal and the UK, and your donations are used as aid.</p><p>Be rest assured that your donations will go to superb causes, though if you're not bothered about that and would just like to sponsor me, then here's why: I broke my ankle 2 years ago and have pushed really hard to be stronger and fitter. 2017's Trailwalker was tough physically but I had worked hard to be ready for it. A year has gone by and I'm not sure I'm any fitter. Unfortunately, I had a mental breakdown caused by stress and anxiety, partly because of another injury that prevented me from exercising to my full potential. I had found that exercise and most notably running was significant in lessening my anxiety, and the achievements from pushing myself made me feel stronger mentally as well as physically. It's not a great thing to be motivated by goals as things can happen to stop you reaching them, but over the last 2 years I have learnt where my limits are and with every pitfall comes learning. I go into Trailwalker 2018 with experience and a more stable attitude. It still won't be made easier, and perhaps it will rain for 20 hours as opposed to 10, or perhaps it'll be exceedingly hot and we'll have to work as a team in a different way. My team Rich, Rachel and George are strong, motivated and have a desire to do this for the challenge - otherwise no way could the physical pain be a purely selfless act in raising donations. <br/></p><p>Though last year I did a lot of mountain hiking, scrambling and trail running as training, this year I'm going more for endurance. I realise that I am pretty good at pushing myself, even with knockbacks, and so will be doing solo ultra long-distance walking and increasing my running distances. Where last year was about making up for missing out on mountain time, this year is about working towards a bigger picture and learning from experience. Trailwalker 2018 is part of that.

Maybe 20 years ago this would be something we could do far easier but given the gradient, distance, time requirements and injuries we all seem to be carrying it will be a challenge for us all. Doing it together will mean we will only fail to do this if a limb is falling off so even if it turns in to a war of attrition we will continue.</p><p>The event sponsor for this is Oxfam and obviously the press has not been great lately due to a stupid few. At first we thought long and hard about participation continuing (we signed up in Nov 2017) but the reality is the people in the wrong where not the people that need the help. As such after considerable research into what Oxfam actually do, we decided to continue our participation.</p><p>If you fancy helping 3 aging guys, who all have joint issues / muscle trouble or general issues,  try to achieve something and hopefully help a few people on the way it would be greatly appreciated. As well as the aging guys there is a small support team that we have and without their participation we could not do this. Arguably their task is harder given they are available for the duration of the event and are required to support us on the way so any sponsorship raised is also clearly their achievement as well.

For example, after Hurricane Matthew hit Haiti in 2016, Oxfam got clean water running as quickly as possible to prevent the spread of dangerous disease. As well as distributing emergency tarpaulins and hygiene kits to keep people safe after the hurricane, we’re staying in Haiti until people can face the future with hope once more.<br/>The Gurkha Welfare Trust in action<br/>The Gurkhas are soldiers from Nepal who are recruited into the British Army. To this day, they remain renowned for their loyalty, professionalism and bravery.<br/>The Gurkha Welfare Trust exists to ensure that Gurkha veterans, their widows and their wider communities are able to live their lives with dignity in Nepal. We achieve this primarily through the provision of financial, medical and community aid.<br/>92 year-old Lalbahadur Pun has received a Welfare Pension from the Trust for 30 years. Lal now resides in our Residential Home in Pokhara where he often reminisces with his fellow Gurkhas and his experiences during World War Two.<br/>“You found me in my village and gave me this pension, this home.

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Without eyesight I can only imagine how someone would feel... Angry, Devastated, Afraid, Frustrated, Isolated, Alone, Different, Lost, Confused.... These are just a few of the many emotions blind people and their parents feel when their child is diagnosed with a lifelong eye condition.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The beauty of this world is felt by the heart but seen by eyes. I believe no-one should be denied this independence, this basic human sense or jewel of the body, if something can be done to rectify it.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">“There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle” and I believe that every dream can come true with hard work and determination. My name is Sehrish Zafar and I am an entertainment journalist and a TV Presenter. I understand it is not easy to encourage people to think optimistically, so that's where my charismatic personality and charm can help inspire people to make a difference in the society.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I am currently a freelance TV Presenter for various UK asian channels; I host at many stage events: fashion, charity, political and award ceremonies especially within our community. I am a graduate of BA Business Management and an award holder of 'Miss Perfect' at college.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Other achievements include fundraising for charities like Save the Children, Ucare Foundation; working as an Events Director of Pakistan Youth Foundation - Organised dinner events for Pakistani politicians, protests against Burma and Gaza Killings, promoted local community cultural music events, visited House of Commons and Pakistan High Commission on many occasions to support our community.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">As I have selflessly helped support the dreams of others and those of my community, I hope I will continue to receive the help and support I seek to fundraise for those in need the most. I am fasting in aid of Sightsavers and your generous support in this great cause will aid me to do more for the ones who need the help most. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Sightsavers believes that no one should be blind from avoidable causes, and that people’s whose sight can’t be saved should live with dignity and independence.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>Did you know?</strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">There are 39 million blind people in the world</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">80% of blindness can be prevented or cured</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Around 90% of visually impaired people live in the world’s poorest countries</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">So the problems Sightsavers are trying to tackle are pretty enormous.</p>

I poo pooed them and said I had never even run across the road for a bus and there was no way I could go running but it stuck with me and I kept thinking about it.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>When I got home I felt physically and mentally strong after walking 192 miles even though my feet felt like horse’s hooves.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>I decided not to let the strength disappear and so I downloaded the app, Couch to 5K, and tentatively started the first 1 minute run that nearly killed me. Soon I was running a bit more every week and eventually I reached the 5K (30 minutes) and I cried. Not from pain but from the sense of achievement.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>I quickly decided to down load the app 5k-10k and set off to double my distance over a period of months. Eventually cracking the 10K distance.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>At this point I didn’t know if I should continue as I was worried I was too old and would destroy my knees. But my sensible head went out of the window as I downloaded the app 10K-21K and started to work towards the half marathon. I live in Ealing and there is a very good half marathon every year in September which goes right past the front of my house. I usually go out every year to clap the runners past, never dreaming that I would ever be able to do such a thing. (As of September 24th 2017 I have now completed that half marathon in 2 hours and 8 minutes and am very happy with that time for my first effort.)</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>I then received an email from Margaret (one of the ladies who was on the coast to Coast walk) to say that her friend Karen was going to be running in the London Marathon in April 2017 for charity and would we consider sponsoring her. Karen was very special to us, she was not just any old friend of Margaret, she went out of her way to drive across the UK with a box of homemade chocolate brownies and a bottle of fizz for us all on our last day. She met us in a small village about 2 hours walk from Robin Hood’s Bay (our final destination) with the brownies to share out amongst us to give us all a chocolate boost and then drove on to Robin Hood’s Bay with the fizz and shared it all out with a glass for each of us to celebrate our wonderful achievement as we dipped our toes in the water. What a wonderful friend.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>Of course, I sponsored Karen, after all, one good turn deserves another even after one and a half years had gone by. I then spent all of Sunday morning trying to spot her on TV in the marathon. It was at this point that I decided I could do this. I could run that marathon too as I watched everyone running the course. So here I am with a place and am absolutely </span>petrified<span>, what have I done? But I WILL do this and hope to raise a good sum for Sightsavers and all those eyesights that will be restored to people who have lost hope.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>I hated sports at school and was always useless. Sports day was my biggest nightmare as I ran around hurdles and under the high jump and would hide in the toilets. Who would think that in my 60th year I would attempt to do such a thing as run the London marathon? I wish my teachers could see me now.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>Last year I ran in my first ever race, the Osterley 10K. it was 26 degrees that morning but I completed it in literally seconds over the hour and am now the proud owner of my first ever running medal. (I went to bed in it that night and woke up with the medal part under my armpit ) I have since hung it up to remind me of what i can achieve when I decide to do something. My Ealing Half marathon was run in 20 degrees and full sunshine but I completed it and now have a second medal which I also wore to bed that night!! I can feel a tradition starting here.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>At the beginning of February I also completed, with a personal best of 57 minutes, the London Winter 10k run with 20,000 other people, starting in Trafalgar Square and running basically to St Paul's and back round the streets of London. It was freezing cold but so much fun and honestly, I felt like I would have liked to turn round and do it all again when I got to the end. I wanted to experience what it was like to run with so many people in London before the big MARATHON day.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>If any of you want to support me on the day I am suggesting making a large banner of some kind with my name on it so I can see it and know where to look for you. I don't want to miss anyone that makes the effort to come out to give me encouragement. I have realised it's so hard to spot people in the crowd as I am running along.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>I wrote a blog about my Coast to Coast walk if you want to read about my effort. How did I know that it would be the start of something much larger?</span></p><p class=""p1""><a href=""http://lozandherboots.blogspot.co.uk/"">http://lozandherboots.blogspot.co.uk/</a></p><p class=""p1""><span>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

A few months ago I went one better and benefitted from the incredible technology of Laser Eye Surgery. Within 3 days I was deemed legal to drive without visual aid (pretty hard to comprehend when you've lived through -8.5).<br/><br/>Wearing glasses wasn't an issue (unsurprisingly I was used to it), but I always felt vulnerable to any situation in which they could be ripped away. In an emergency my confidence and independence would instantly be gone. And yet too many people don't even have the privilege of a simple pair of glasses or access to the everyday eye care that we can take for granted.

Mariyah was diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma, an extremely aggressive form of cancer at the age of 7 and a half and engaged in a battle with it up until the age of 16, where she endured a plethora of treatments including chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery in both conventional and experimental variations. She was subjected to an overwhelming bombardment of hardship, pain and suffering throughout her years but despite that she continued to plough on with her strong character, will and determination. </p><p><span>The tumour originated in her femur and then continued to grow and metastasise around her body but she continued to fight it at every step of its progression. She endured inhumane amounts of pain, sickness and suffering caused by combination of the disease and the side effects of the rudimentary treatments that exist today. These did not phase her up until December 2016 when she was experiencing severe headaches and blurry vision and we were told that the cancer had metastasised</span><span> into her brain which is extremely rare for her form and that it was applying pressure to her eyes, thus distorting her vision. She underwent radiotherapy which was unsuccessful and we were not able to contain the tumour within her. It continued to </span><span>colonise</span><span> her brain and eventually it grew on her optic nerves and she effectively lost her vision. </span></p><p><span>Mariyah had endured every side effect and possible manifestation of pain but it did not defeat her, however when she lost her eyesight, she was </span><span>absolutely</span><span> </span><span>distraught. Her character had changed, her will wasted away and she began to lose herself and eventually so would we. For Mariyah, her vision was her connection to the outside world, even when she was cornered by the unstoppable forces of nature within her, it allowed her to see the comforting smile of her parents faces or even the photos that would evoke her favourite memories that would provide her with the hope and thus determination to fight; however when this connection was severed she was defeated as she entered the dark abyss of the end of her life. </span><br/></p><p><span>Sadly, she lost her battle on the 19th of April 2017. However, before she had passed she had heard about Sighsavers and their pledge to treat blind children and restore their vision by removing their cataracts. When she heard that it would only cost £4 per eye, she immediately wanted to contribute to restore the vision of as many children as she could as she was enraged that it could be done so easily</span><span>.

She gave to dozens of charities, worked in a charity shop for years, and organized the Red Cross charity flag sellers in her parish for 30 years, all unpaid and out of the goodness of her large heart. </p><p><span>But Sightsavers was especially close to that heart, the one cause above all others that she wanted to support. For her, blindness was the most terrible of afflictions, and Sightsavers' mission to eliminate avoidable blindness and to make the world a fairer place for people with such disabilities was something that deserved the widest possible support.</span><br/></p><p>And while she loved flowers, she always thought it wrong that money would be lavished on flowers for a funeral (which wouldn't benefit the deceased), when it could be spent to much better effect and benefit far more by being given to a good cause such as Sightsavers.<br/><br/>Phoebe was not a great one for computers, always preferring handwritten letters, phone calls and face-to-face contact, but she diligently attended a computer class for years, learning (just about) how to read and write emails. She was a great pragmatist, however, and she did accept that, even if it was all gobbledygook to her, the internet could be harnessed for good purposes. Hence this page – and the comparable one for her late, much missed husband Dick (https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/richardwoollcombe) in aid of the Alzheimer's Society – had her blessing, in the hopes that it would help her precious cause of Sightsavers. </p><p>So, whether you knew Phoebe and want to give something in her memory, or whether you think Sightsavers is an admirable cause and deserves support, thank you for whatever you can give.</p><p>PS  Why is this page called Phoebe's Online Egg Round? Simple: as anyone who lived near her will know, once a week she would go round the local village selling eggs from her hens to friends and neighbours. She always called this her egg round, and it became very much a social event, with her driving home full to the gills after 15 cups of tea and endless chat. She also milked it for all she was worth when she was selling flags for the Red Cross. This page is very much in the same shameless spirit, hence the name!</p><p><span>Finally, here's the official blurb:</span></p><p><span>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

page.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">At a dinner party recently, my friend Amar, CEO of
Traveleyes, which provides multi-sensory group holidays for both blind
and sighted travellers, was telling me about the 10th anniversary plans for his
company (actually, he was trying to flog me a ticket to the ball, but when I
heard about the plans for the charity abseil, I jumped in as the first volunteer). &nbsp;<span style=""word-spacing: normal;"">I've jumped from a plane at 15,000 feet, surely stepping off
the Armouries can't be that scary, right?!</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Amar is blind himself and never lets it stand in his
way.&nbsp; Just one of the things he's done is
a 220 mile trek from the Atlantic to the Pacific Coast of Nicaragua.&nbsp; He and other blind and partially sighted
friends inspire me and show that we can achieve anything we put our minds to! &nbsp;There are some cases
where sight can be saved though and this is why I’d like to raise funds for
Sightsavers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Opposite my gran’s house in
Delhi, India, was an Institution for the Blind. &nbsp;My parents always took some form of donation when we visited, so I’ve seen first-hand how even simple procedures can restore sight.</p><p>
