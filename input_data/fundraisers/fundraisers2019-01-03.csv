As a member of STA UK (Society of Technical Analysts) I will again be taking part in the JPMorgan Corporate Challenge run happening on Thur 05, 2018. <br /><br />This year I took a more “academic approach"" in selecting a global cause that needs our attention (for a great insight check https://80000hours.org) and ended up with... fighting the biggest killer of children in Africa - malaria. <br /><br />Why? Some sad facts:<br /><br />- Malaria kills one child every 30 seconds, about 3000 children every day. Over one million people die from malaria each year, mostly children under five years of age, with 90 per cent of malaria cases occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa (UNICEF, 2003. Yes, the source is old and the situation improved a lot, but you could nevertheless estimate the scale of the problem).<br /><br />- The disease costs the African economy more than $12 billion every year and a slows the economic growth of countries with high malaria rates of 1.3% - it's draining countries, continents and communities. Malaria takes it's toll on the poorest and continues to keep them in a cycle of poverty.<br /><br />The good news is:<br /><br />- Sleeping under insecticide-treated mosquito nets protects against malaria<br /><br />- Early diagnosis and treatment of malaria reduces desease and prevents malaria and an overall situation is improving. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUq0byqxluk&t=10s<br /><br />- BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, by just skipping your next mornings' Starbucks coffee YOU CAN DO GOOD NOW. For just a few dollars, a child is protected with seasonal malaria chemoprevention each year.<br /><br />Many, many thanks to all of you!<br /><br />Regards, <br /><br />Nikolay<br /><br />http://malariaconsortium.org (a charity that I'm supporting that is proven to be able to deliver and be cost-effective)<br /><br />http://80000hours.org (for more inspiration on how to spend your work time with a greater impact)<br /><br />Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

However, over a year ago, I set up a photo gallery on Flickr:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/kennymathieson/"" target=""mytarget"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/kennymathieson/</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This&nbsp;has resulted in my photos being seen by a much wider audience. From time to time, I receive requests to use my photos in publications, or indeed I'm asked to provide photographic services.</p>
<p>So, I thought it might be nice to raise some additional money for a charity I support anyway, via this route. Why do I support Sightsavers? Well, there are&nbsp;various reasons. One of my closest friends is blind and I'm keenly aware of the challenges he faces on a daily basis, living in our technologically-enabled Western world. However, I've also travelled the globe quite extensively, and I know that difficult enough as life is if you lose your sight here, the practical difficulties increase exponentially in Third World countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My photography has given me a lot of pleasure, allowing me to interpret the world through my eyes. It seems only appropriate that I repay some of that debt, by using it to allow others to continue to simply <u>experience</u> the world through their eyes.</p>
<p>Many thanks for your support.</p>

We couldn't really afford it and it seemed strange to be thinking of Christmas on a beautiful sunny day in spring but we got him anyway. We had just had coffee in Saint Mark's Square and were&nbsp;incredibly happy...</p><p>My husband and I have since separated&nbsp;and this&nbsp;lead me to question whether the Santa would be a&nbsp;source of&nbsp;sadness and&nbsp;irritation or whether it would remind me of a&nbsp;lovely memory. I decided that it had to be the latter and&nbsp;also to appreciate the little things at Christmas that I have&nbsp;so easily taken for granted in the past. As I continued decorating the tree, I realised that the&nbsp;<em>sights</em> of Christmas are so important and that vision (at all times of the year) makes a massive contribution as to how we interpret and experience the world and the joy we take from living.</p><p>On the Sightsavers website I learnt that: <em>there are 39 million blind people in the world, 80% of blindness can be prevented or cured and 90% of visually impaired people live in the world's poorest countries.</em> The idea of 'baubles for the blind' popped into my&nbsp;head and the concept that&nbsp;people&nbsp;could post the sights of Christmas that are uniquely theirs and part of their history but then donate a small amount to a charity where just £4 will fund a cataract operation and give a child back their sight, £8 provides a trachoma operation to stop 12 people going blind and £12 can prevent 2184 people losing their sight to river blindness...</p><p>Unlike most fundraising ideas however, 'Giving the gift of sight' will only work if everyone joins in! I had the idea but really after I have posted&nbsp;my story&nbsp;and photos&nbsp;(and got the ball rolling) it will be out of my hands what happens. I do not need to train for&nbsp;weeks to complete some impressive physical feat, bake cakes or buy expensive equipment. Also, there is no guarantee that anyone will post a picture or that those who do&nbsp;will then follow the link and give any money. My idea then rests on trust, it relies on goodwill and has at its heart a&nbsp;wish to make a small but significant difference. if this brings a positive change and can help one person, I will be happy and so, of course, will they...</p><p>For more information go to: <a href=""http://www.sightsavers.net/"">http://www.sightsavers.net/</a></p><p>Thanks for taking the time to visit my JustGiving page.</p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

<P>About&nbsp;six years ago, David bravely agreed to start up from scratch and chair a new regulatory body, the Legal Services Board,&nbsp;which came into being&nbsp;following the passing of the Legal Services Act 2007. It is fair to say that the&nbsp;regulators of the various sections of the legal profession were not universally welcoming to the new organisation, and while personal relationships with key players have remained good,&nbsp;at an organisational level the LSB's existence and role continues to be questioned.</P>
<P>Against this backdrop, and largely through David's leadership, the LSB has achieved a great deal, not least the successful rolling out of the Alternative Business Structure model of service delivery which has led the way in&nbsp; bringing new and innovative thinking into the way legal businesses work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>As David prepares to&nbsp;hand the over the baton, this is a time&nbsp;for reflection on his and the organisation's many achievements, and to raise a glass to the man himself.</P>
<P>As David has made it clear that he doesn't want a present, we would appreciate it if Board members, past and present and other friends, could instead give towards the important work of this very worthy charity, which David himself supports, as a tribute to his efforts over the last six years.&nbsp;</P>

She gave to dozens of charities, worked in a charity shop for years, and organized the Red Cross charity flag sellers in her parish for 30 years, all unpaid and out of the goodness of her large heart. </p><p><span>But Sightsavers was especially close to that heart, the one cause above all others that she wanted to support. For her, blindness was the most terrible of afflictions, and Sightsavers' mission to eliminate avoidable blindness and to make the world a fairer place for people with such disabilities was something that deserved the widest possible support.</span><br/></p><p>And while she loved flowers, she always thought it wrong that money would be lavished on flowers for a funeral (which wouldn't benefit the deceased), when it could be spent to much better effect and benefit far more by being given to a good cause such as Sightsavers.<br/><br/>Phoebe was not a great one for computers, always preferring handwritten letters, phone calls and face-to-face contact, but she diligently attended a computer class for years, learning (just about) how to read and write emails. She was a great pragmatist, however, and she did accept that, even if it was all gobbledygook to her, the internet could be harnessed for good purposes. Hence this page – and the comparable one for her late, much missed husband Dick (https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/richardwoollcombe) in aid of the Alzheimer's Society – had her blessing, in the hopes that it would help her precious cause of Sightsavers. </p><p>So, whether you knew Phoebe and want to give something in her memory, or whether you think Sightsavers is an admirable cause and deserves support, thank you for whatever you can give.</p><p>PS  Why is this page called Phoebe's Online Egg Round? Simple: as anyone who lived near her will know, once a week she would go round the local village selling eggs from her hens to friends and neighbours. She always called this her egg round, and it became very much a social event, with her driving home full to the gills after 15 cups of tea and endless chat. She also milked it for all she was worth when she was selling flags for the Red Cross. This page is very much in the same shameless spirit, hence the name!</p><p><span>Finally, here's the official blurb:</span></p><p><span>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

He couldn't believe, that for so little money, children all over the world could have their vision returned and yet so many were still left blind and vulnerable. He had already donated to this cause himself.</p><p>13 days after grandad picked this charity for us, on 13th July 2018, he passed away surrounded by many people that loved him. Grandad's life was lived with love, kindness and generosity and it seems fitting that we should be remembering him by giving to a cause that meant a lot to him. Please give generously for us in his honour.</p><p>Grandad you will be missed but it's hard to be too sad when someone lived such a great life and touched so many people.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>",Alex Nalson & Michelle Powell's Wedding,25,0,100,6,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Alex Nalson and Michelle Powell,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Alex Nalson & Michelle Powell's Wedding,https://www.justgiving.com/Shell-and-Alex-get-married,/Shell-and-Alex-get-married,United Kingdom,,Alex Nalson & Michelle Powell's Wedding,//images.justgiving.com/image/cabe945b-7a8b-48c9-bd46-2d2da2248cca.png?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,12.073148,Alexandra Nalson,2018-07-21T10:52:35,179,4895203,2019-02-23T00:00:00,1550,12271,NA,NA,Sightsavers,207544,2019-01-04T15:22:08Z

page.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">At a dinner party recently, my friend Amar, CEO of
Traveleyes, which provides multi-sensory group holidays for both blind
and sighted travellers, was telling me about the 10th anniversary plans for his
company (actually, he was trying to flog me a ticket to the ball, but when I
heard about the plans for the charity abseil, I jumped in as the first volunteer). &nbsp;<span style=""word-spacing: normal;"">I've jumped from a plane at 15,000 feet, surely stepping off
the Armouries can't be that scary, right?!</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Amar is blind himself and never lets it stand in his
way.&nbsp; Just one of the things he's done is
a 220 mile trek from the Atlantic to the Pacific Coast of Nicaragua.&nbsp; He and other blind and partially sighted
friends inspire me and show that we can achieve anything we put our minds to! &nbsp;There are some cases
where sight can be saved though and this is why I’d like to raise funds for
Sightsavers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Opposite my gran’s house in
Delhi, India, was an Institution for the Blind. &nbsp;My parents always took some form of donation when we visited, so I’ve seen first-hand how even simple procedures can restore sight.</p><p>

A few months ago I went one better and benefitted from the incredible technology of Laser Eye Surgery. Within 3 days I was deemed legal to drive without visual aid (pretty hard to comprehend when you've lived through -8.5).<br/><br/>Wearing glasses wasn't an issue (unsurprisingly I was used to it), but I always felt vulnerable to any situation in which they could be ripped away. In an emergency my confidence and independence would instantly be gone. And yet too many people don't even have the privilege of a simple pair of glasses or access to the everyday eye care that we can take for granted.

The race starts at midday on Saturday 4th August and competitors run as many laps of the 9km course (5.6 miles) as they can before midday on Sunday 5th. <br/><br/>I can’t really remember why I ended up doing this race as I don’t really like running, but it had something to do with David Goggins, raising money for Sightsavers (makes doing really stupid events seem less stupid) and finding out if I could actually run 100 miles in 24 hours.<br/><br/>There are many factors that influence the success of a 100-mile run, but I would say that two of the main ones, at least for me, are the course and the weather. The Cotswold 24 Hour Race course is described as “an off-road, 9km mixed course including forest trails and open tarmac paths”. In the world of running, the term “trail” has a pretty broad meaning, encompassing everything from flat, smooth, maintained, wood-chip covered paths, to uneven, off-camber-rock-strewn-pot-holed -ankle-twisting-leg-breaking-unrunnable-mountains. I have a permanent ankle injury (gross instability of the left ankle) so have been advised not to run on uneven surfaces; I was hoping the course was as flat and as even as it’s possible for a trail to be. (NB: There is absolutely no reason why I couldn’t have recced the course before the event and found out exactly how even/uneven it was, but I didn’t – big oversight on my part.)<br/><br/>There’s not much you can do about the weather and really it is part of the challenge. But this weekend the weather would be particularly challenging, because the forecast was “fricking boiling”.<br/><br/>These kinds of events are always more fun if you know some other people who are taking part, and I am lucky enough to be friends with Claire Smith (UK’s top female ultra-endurance athlete, 7th woman in the world to complete a Deca Ironman triathlon), who had done the race twice before. Claire would be using the race as training for a Quin Triathlon at the end of August, which in turn would be training for another Deca Triathlon in November (I’m not making this up). Claire is vastly experienced with ultra-distance racing, and her help with pacing would be crucial towards the end of the race. Paul (a friend since school) was also running, but as he’d done a lot less training than me he had not set a target mileage and was just going to see how far he could go. Another good friend, Baljinder “B-Real” BoSingh, a Doctor of Emergency Medicine, would be crewing for me and making sure I didn’t die.<br/><br/>My parents dropped off Paul and I at the Solo Competitor camping ground and we put up Paul’s mega tent. Hopefully we wouldn’t need it, but it’s good to have somewhere to stash all the gear and get out of the elements if required. B-Real arrived around 10:00am and Claire turned up soon after. B-Real told us how little sleep he’d had over the past few days, working long shifts in A&amp;E and looking after his 1-year-old son who was determined to stay awake. As is always the case with me and racing, my brain had decided that I didn’t need any sleep either, and had kept me awake the entire night. Obviously, staying awake for 24 hours is not enough of a challenge, let’s make it 48. Thanks a lot, brain.<br/><br/>The race started on time and off we went, lap number 1. My plan was to try and get the first 50 miles (9 laps) completed in 10 hours. This would leave me with 6 hours for the next 25 miles and 8 hours for the final 25. The first lap would tell me if my plan was going to work or not. <br/><br/>The whole course is very scenic, but I quickly found that with my wobbly ankle I would not be able to run a lot of it. The first 3km go through woods and around fields, but the surface was pretty uneven: stones, roots, lumps and bumps. Then a runnable section of dirt road up to the first aid station, at the top of the ornamental drive looking down towards Cirencester Parish Church tower. The ornamental drive is a smooth tarmac surface that slopes downhill, but in some places too steep to run, especially if I want to make my legs last 100 miles. At the bottom of the drive there is another tarmac section just past 5km that can be run… until it turns steeply uphill, and it’s back to walking for another 100 metres or so. Although the road still slopes up hill, it’s possible to run up to about 6.5km before the course turns off into a field. After that it’s a rough-but-runnable section of single track to approximately 7.5km, then approximately 500 metres through a field before the route turns back on to a broken single-track road. Kilometre 8 to the finish is runnable.<br/><br/>The first lap took just over 51 minutes which was on pace for the target of 50 miles in the first 10 hours, but I was slightly concerned about the sections I had ran on that lap which I knew I would not be able to run on future laps. My other concern was the intense heat; the aid stations only supplied water, and I would need to be consuming a lot of electrolytes to replace those lost through sweating. I had planned on carrying 400ml of electrolyte drink per lap, filling my bottle at the half-way point with water, then topping up with electrolytes at the end of each lap which B-Real was mixing up for me. I had drunk all my electrolytes in the first 3km and was feeling pretty thirsty before I even got to the aid station just short of 4km. After a couple of laps, I told B-Real to double the strength of the electrolyte mix and give me two 600ml bottles to carry. I was now drinking over 2 litres of fluid per hour, I was bathed in sweat, and it felt like it was getting hotter. <br/><br/>I had bought a lot of food for the event, but I quickly found the only solid food I could eat was half a banana each lap. I took a “lemon meringue flavoured” gel (they don’t taste like any lemon meringue pie I’ve ever eaten, but I could at least keep them down) each lap at the halfway point. Apart from not wanting to eat, I wasn’t feeling too bad. <br/><br/>By lap 5 I had established a pretty consistent run/walk strategy, and with one marathon completed I was cautiously optimistic about my 50 miles in 10 hours target. It was still very hot, but my legs were feeling ok.<br/><br/>I stopped to do a blister check after 7 laps (just after 7:00pm) and found that my feet were black with dirt. I washed my feet and, in the process, found a blister on my big toe. I drained the blister and wrapped the toe in surgical tape, put on some fresh socks and consulted B-Real on the next issue that was slightly concerning me; even though I was drinking gallons, I hadn’t needed to pee. I was sweating freely and showing no signs of dehydration or cramping, but even so…. we made a note to monitor the pee situation.<br/><br/>The sun started to go down on lap 8. Although running would be harder once it got dark, at least it would be cooler. I picked up a t-shirt and headtorch from B-Real at the end of the lap and set off again. By 10:00pm I had covered 50 miles, but I’d also drank over 20 litres of fluid and still hadn’t needed to pee. Although I felt more-or-less fine, was there something wrong with my kidneys? Could I really have lost 20 litres of water through sweating alone? Sometime after 11:30pm normal service was resumed and I was rewarded with a new tune to sing in my head for the next few laps. The song was “I can see clearly now the rain has gone”, but the lyrics had morphed into “I can pee clearly now the sun has gone, I pee on all obstacles in my way”. To my sleep deprived, banana-and-gel fuelled brain this was hilarious, and I felt surprisingly good for the next couple of laps.<br/><br/>By lap 12 my legs were pretty sore and I was having trouble bending them. Although I could still run, the difference in speed between running and walking was negligible. By now every step hurt, but running hurt the most so it made sense to try and walk as fast as possible and hope that I still had enough in my legs to make up time at the end. I started calculating times in my head for each kilometre, each lap, how much time there was left… if I kept walking at my current pace, I wouldn’t complete 100 miles within the 24-hour cut off. Even though it would hurt, I knew I could still run - but I didn’t know how long I’d be able to keep it up, so I’d have to save my legs until the end. The last few laps were going to be as much about pain management as they would be about running.<br/><br/>At some point during the night I started to get cold, so stopped for more layers, a woolly hat, and to treat a few more blisters. I use Topo Athletic running shoes, the best shoes I’ve ever ran in. I had been completely blister-free in training, but the problem with running 100 miles is that the feet you start with are not the feet you finish with. A combination of dirt, sweat, swollen feet, uneven surfaces and the general attrition of taking thousands and thousands of steps were taking their toll. Needles, surgical tape and anti-septic gel would get me back on course, as long as I had B-Real to help me stand up again after I’d sat down. <br/><br/>The sun came up at the start of lap 15. I’d hoped to complete as many laps as possible before the heat picked up again. 80 miles done, 20 to go, and I now need to make up some time. Despite my sore feet I stomped around lap 16, knowing that Claire would help with the pacing on the penultimate lap. We started lap 17 with 3 hours and 3 minutes until cut off. I told Claire I needed to finish this lap in 1 hour 30 minutes to have enough time for lap 18. We completed the lap in 1 hour 30 minutes and 10 seconds. I have no idea how she does that.<br/><br/>For the final lap I was joined by Dr B-Real, who was clearly pleased to be moving again, having spent most of the past 23 hours standing around looking out for me. Unfortunately I had to apologise that I wouldn’t really be able to talk much, as all my concentration would be taken up with placing every step as carefully as possible to limit the risk of a trip/stumble/strain that could end my race, and managing the pain in my legs and feet. B-Real was great, carrying my bottles and keeping me topped up with food and drink, and could easily match my pace; 90+ miles certainly takes it out of you. We made the turn at the bottom of the ornamental drive in front of Cirencester Parish Church tower and ran to the 5km marker. I was surprised that my legs responded pretty well, and it actually felt like I was running with my own legs rather than legs I’d borrowed off someone else who had left them in a shed for a few years. <br/><br/>Some more walking on the steep part of the hill, then back to running. Once again, I was surprised that I could actually run – it hurt, but it wasn’t unbearable. I put my head down and kept going until 6.5km. I had been checking time/pace for each kilometre, but probably due to sleep deprivation and not being very good at maths, I’d calculated that I only had a minute in hand (we needed to cover each kilometre in exactly 10 minutes, but I had added an extra 10 minutes for kilometre 9… which is the finish, so clearly I didn’t need to run an extra kilometre after that). I kept an eye on the watch and ran all the runnable sections. By 8km I’d stopped looking. There was nothing for it now but to run.<br/><br/>I entered the finishing straight and crossed the line in a time of 23:48:05, having covered a total of 100.6 miles. Only in the last few hundred meters did I realise that I actually had almost 12 minutes spare, rather than the 2 minutes I thought I had. Still, none of that mattered once I’d crossed the finish line – hugs all round, and a question answered: yes, I can run 100 miles in under 24 hours… just.<br/><br/><b>Huge thanks:</b></p><p><span>B-Real, Claire Swear, The A Man, Dr Banner and The HULK, and of course Ma &amp; Pa Dales, for all the support. </span><span>Everyone involved in organising, marshalling and every other aspect of running the Cotswold 24 Hour Race.

Mariyah was diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma, an extremely aggressive form of cancer at the age of 7 and a half and engaged in a battle with it up until the age of 16, where she endured a plethora of treatments including chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery in both conventional and experimental variations. She was subjected to an overwhelming bombardment of hardship, pain and suffering throughout her years but despite that she continued to plough on with her strong character, will and determination. </p><p><span>The tumour originated in her femur and then continued to grow and metastasise around her body but she continued to fight it at every step of its progression. She endured inhumane amounts of pain, sickness and suffering caused by combination of the disease and the side effects of the rudimentary treatments that exist today. These did not phase her up until December 2016 when she was experiencing severe headaches and blurry vision and we were told that the cancer had metastasised</span><span> into her brain which is extremely rare for her form and that it was applying pressure to her eyes, thus distorting her vision. She underwent radiotherapy which was unsuccessful and we were not able to contain the tumour within her. It continued to </span><span>colonise</span><span> her brain and eventually it grew on her optic nerves and she effectively lost her vision. </span></p><p><span>Mariyah had endured every side effect and possible manifestation of pain but it did not defeat her, however when she lost her eyesight, she was </span><span>absolutely</span><span> </span><span>distraught. Her character had changed, her will wasted away and she began to lose herself and eventually so would we. For Mariyah, her vision was her connection to the outside world, even when she was cornered by the unstoppable forces of nature within her, it allowed her to see the comforting smile of her parents faces or even the photos that would evoke her favourite memories that would provide her with the hope and thus determination to fight; however when this connection was severed she was defeated as she entered the dark abyss of the end of her life. </span><br/></p><p><span>Sadly, she lost her battle on the 19th of April 2017. However, before she had passed she had heard about Sighsavers and their pledge to treat blind children and restore their vision by removing their cataracts. When she heard that it would only cost £4 per eye, she immediately wanted to contribute to restore the vision of as many children as she could as she was enraged that it could be done so easily</span><span>. Even though she knew that her vision could not be restored, she wanted to impact the lives of those that could be treated as she had endured </span>their pain. She wanted to add this extremely personal pledge to her portfolio of charitable work but unfortunately she was not able to do so. Therefore, we would like to carry out Mariyah's wish to pledge and continue her profound impact on this planet by giving the gift of sight. </p>",Fundraising in loving memory of Mariyah Jasrai,1710,0,11245,112,0,NA,NA,I am fundraising because I would like to restore the eyesight of 2500 kids.,I am fundraising,I would like to restore the eyesight of 2500 kids.,Mariyah Jasrai,443883,Mariyah Jasrai,/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/9935335,remember/443883,NA,NA,In memory of Mariyah Jasrai,https://www.justgiving.com/Sofian-Jasrai,/Sofian-Jasrai,United Kingdom,,Fundraising in loving memory of Mariyah Jasrai,//images.justgiving.com/image/ca556780-635e-476e-9cd9-1e00c1692d99.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,12.073148,Sofian Jasrai,2017-04-26T22:04:24,179,4210958,2017-04-26T22:04:24,10000,12271,I am fundraising,I would like to restore the eyesight of 2500 kids.,Sightsavers,207544,2019-01-04T15:22:08Z
