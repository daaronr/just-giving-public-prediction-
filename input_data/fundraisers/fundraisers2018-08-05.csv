Cool Earth is a non-profit organisation that works alongside rainforest communities to halt deforestation and climate change, and whose work is endorsed by Sir David Attenborough.

This is a 10,000 mile trip from London to Mongolia with the finish line in a town called Ulan Ude just North of the Mongolian border. This Mammoth road trip has to be completed in a car that is 1L or less with no off-road adaptations to make the journey easier. The trip will be a challenging but EPIC adventure across deserts, mountain ranges and into totally unfamiliar lands.</p><p>We have chosen to do this trip in support of the Cool Earth. This is the official Mongol Rally charity that works with local communities to save the worlds most at risk rainforests. With the size of rainforests globally decreasing rapidly this is a very worthwhile charity to support. They have already saved areas of rainforest by working closely with the people who live in them which is a new strategy that is proving majorly successful. </p><p>Please help us raise money for this worthwhile charity by donating.

We are going to be taking part in the Mongol Rally 2014 which essentially involves driving a pile of rust from England to Mongol across 7000 miles of tarmac, dirt and in many cases non-exisitant road. You may think we going on a holiday, but I can assure you this is a very serious charity event that has been running for the last 10 years. We will need to purchase a car and get it road fit along with camping and travel equipment but we are hoping to use our own money for this.

So, this is where you come in as I feel like I will have a much better chance of success if I am running for a purpose.</p><p>For a while I have debated various different charities including Save The Children,  Syria Relief, Air Ambulance, <span>ActionAid, Cancer Research and UNICEF.

I ended up searching google for hours, on a mission to find the most cost-effective charities. I wanted to know which charity does the most good in terms of lives saved or improved for every pound it receives. Eventually, I came across </span><a href=""http://www.givewell.org"">www.givewell.org</a><span>, a non-profit organisation that evaluates charities to identify those that do the greatest good. They assess and report on each charities evidence of effectiveness, transparency and cost-effectiveness to make peoples donations go further. Each year, they publish a list of their top-rated charities.</span></p><p>On this list was Malaria Consortium, a world leading non-profit organisations specialising in the prevention, control and treatment of malaria and other communicable diseases among vulnerable populations.</p><p>Current statistics from the World Health Organisation estimate that 445,000 people die as consequence of malaria each year. In 2015, 303,000 children died before their firth birthday. It is estimated that malaria kills one child dies every minute. I find these horrifying statistics incomprehensible in this day and age but unfortunately, they are accurate. There is strong evidence that seasonal malaria chemoprevention provided by the Malaria Consortium substantially reduces cases of malaria.</p><p>Please help me to raise some money for this incredibly worthy cause.</p><p>Thank you very much</p><p>Issa</p><p>If you would like further information, please visit:</p><p><a href=""https://www.givewell.org/charities/malaria-consortium"">https://www.givewell.org/charities/malaria-consortium</a></p><p><a href=""http://www.malariaconsortium.org"">http://www.malariaconsortium.org</a></p><p><a href=""http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs094/en/"">http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs094/en/</a></p><p><a href=""http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/malaria/en/"">http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/malaria/en/</a></p>",Issa runs Paris Marathon to help Malaria Consortium,122.50,0,627.94,314,0,https://images.justgiving.com/image/470fc057-cd9d-4562-8c5f-8761fc3a5c73.jpg,https://images.justgiving.com/image/470fc057-cd9d-4562-8c5f-8761fc3a5c73.jpg?template=size150x150face,NA,NA,NA,NA,Paris Marathon because nearly half of the world's population is at risk,Paris Marathon,nearly half of the world's population is at risk,NA,NA,NA,NA,Paris Marathon 2018,https://www.justgiving.com/Issa-Salem,/Issa-Salem,United Kingdom,...Issa runs Paris Marathon to help <strong>Malaria</strong> <strong>Consortium</strong>...,Issa runs Paris Marathon to help Malaria Consortium,//images.justgiving.com/image/626e0214-a325-4d3f-9dc5-dba449c72b3e.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,14.468655,Issa Salem,2018-03-15T20:34:50,181721,4193387,2018-04-08T00:00:00,200,183804,Paris Marathon,nearly half of the world's population is at risk,Malaria Consortium,1099776,2018-08-05T09:18:09Z

As a member of STA UK (Society of Technical Analysts) I will again be taking part in the JPMorgan Corporate Challenge run happening on Thur 05, 2018. <br /><br />This year I took a more “academic approach"" in selecting a global cause that needs our attention (for a great insight check https://80000hours.org) and ended up with... fighting the biggest killer of children in Africa - malaria. <br /><br />Why? Some sad facts:<br /><br />- Malaria kills one child every 30 seconds, about 3000 children every day. Over one million people die from malaria each year, mostly children under five years of age, with 90 per cent of malaria cases occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa (UNICEF, 2003. Yes, the source is old and the situation improved a lot, but you could nevertheless estimate the scale of the problem).<br /><br />- The disease costs the African economy more than $12 billion every year and a slows the economic growth of countries with high malaria rates of 1.3% - it's draining countries, continents and communities. Malaria takes it's toll on the poorest and continues to keep them in a cycle of poverty.<br /><br />The good news is:<br /><br />- Sleeping under insecticide-treated mosquito nets protects against malaria<br /><br />- Early diagnosis and treatment of malaria reduces desease and prevents malaria and an overall situation is improving. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUq0byqxluk&t=10s<br /><br />- BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, by just skipping your next mornings' Starbucks coffee YOU CAN DO GOOD NOW. For just a few dollars, a child is protected with seasonal malaria chemoprevention each year.<br /><br />Many, many thanks to all of you!<br /><br />Regards, <br /><br />Nikolay<br /><br />http://malariaconsortium.org (a charity that I'm supporting that is proven to be able to deliver and be cost-effective)<br /><br />http://80000hours.org (for more inspiration on how to spend your work time with a greater impact)<br /><br />Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

We are a team of four women who are willing to undertake the endurance of the 100K Oxfam TrailWalker Challenge through the South Downs from the Queen Elizabeth County Park in Hampshire, starting at 6am on the 14 July to trek day and night non-stop until we reach Brighton! The event is timed and we plan to finish in sub-24 hours so we can be in Brighton for breakfast! </p><p>This will be the ultimate challenge for our team as we have never undergone an ultra before! Made up of runners, hikers, trailwalkers and cyclists, though our outdoor activity styles are different we all share a love of a challenge and a passion for life. This challenge will definitely be our toughest to date but we are excited to be part of it and work to become Trailwalker Legends!! To hike, walk and run solid for 24 hours will test us to our limits of mental and physical strength. The route was set by The Gurka Signals over 30 years ago as the ultimate test of teamwork and endurance for new recruits with a total ascent of 2,500m - the equivalent of Ben Nevis and Snowdonia combined - this will be no walk in the park. To achieve this challenge we will be training for months to make sure we are Trailwalker fit and to make you all an Oxfam proud!</p><p>For more information about the challenge check out Oxfam's website https://www.oxfam.org.uk/Trailwalker.

So, I would like to take this opportunity to personally invite anyone of you who are reading this post to contribute a part of your value for the cause. </span><br/></p><div><b>This is the least thing I could do to pay my contribution to the world. </b><span>Even though my graphic design service could not help directly in terms giving aid or manpower, but I’ve always wanted to contribute some portion of my services for charity. So, this is my way to be the part of making others living their best life in this world. My goal is to raise as much as possible for the charity drive by raising my service standards to the best quality as possible.</span><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><b>What inspires me to do the charity drive</b> is by looking inspiring from big entrepreneurs out there giving away their life and money to help others. Bill Gates is one of the people I am inspired by, whom donated most of his wealth for charity reasons around the globe. I do realize that I’m not that so called a big company to donate most of my wealth to charity. But I believe that with every small step I’ve made, I could make a difference in someone’s life. <br/><br/>I chose Oxfam as my charity platform because they are doing a great job on giving aids to the needs out there in all around the world. Oxfam is a movement of millions of people, all working towards one goal – an end to poverty for everyone. I believe on what they believed, “In a world rich in resources, poverty isn’t inevitable.” I feel that I’m not the one whom need the most from the resources, so I think I should give my part to someone who need it the most. Oxfam believe that everyone should be able to eat, drink, earn and learn as much as we do. </div><div><br/>T<b>hrough Oxfam and their partners, 4.3 million people got access to clean water, 2 million people got food, cash or vouchers to survive a crisis, and 1.7 million women were supported to exercise their rights. </b>They couldn't have done it without someone like us. </div><div><br/>On average for every £1 donated to Oxfam, they invest 84p on their humanitarian, development and campaigning work. They invest 8p to raise further funds, and they invest 8p on support and running costs such as paying the salaries of staff who work all year round to deliver their work and who ensure they are effective and accountable.</div><div><br/>To conclude and to mention it again, the idea behind the charity drive is to cut off 20% from every income I’ve received from my graphic design service and donating them to charity. So, obviously, the more I get, the more I will give in return and more people I could contribute to. This is my goal. All donation will go straight to my profile at JustGiving.com and will be donated to Oxfam. </div><div><br/>Thank you for all you support!</div><div><br/>Regards,</div><div>Azri Omar<br/><p><span> </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span></span></p><p></p></div>",Ahmad Azri's Charity for Oxfam,0,0,0,0,0,https://images.justgiving.com/image/c5542eaf-6cc7-4391-a315-8877d1c36f21.jpg,https://images.justgiving.com/image/c5542eaf-6cc7-4391-a315-8877d1c36f21.jpg?template=size150x150face,NA,NA,NA,NA,I am raising money because I believe everyone deserves equal benefits.,I am raising money,I believe everyone deserves equal benefits.,NA,NA,NA,NA,Charity for Oxfam,https://www.justgiving.com/Azri-Omar,/Azri-Omar,United Kingdom,...Ahmad Azri's Charity for <strong>Oxfam</strong>...,Ahmad Azri's Charity for Oxfam,//images.justgiving.com/image/36eaf3af-c3b7-4dfa-984d-f5af9531aaae.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,8.39679,Ahmad Azri Omar,2015-12-08T19:35:41,13441,3129090,2015-12-08T19:35:41,500,15524,I am raising money,I believe everyone deserves equal benefits.,Oxfam,202918,2018-08-05T09:18:09Z

I don't believe that anyone should have to live in dangerous and disgusting conditions because it's a human right that we should all feel safe. I just hope eventually things really do get better for everyone!</p>

We will be walking continually for 24-30 hours depending on how fast our legs will carry us!!  It’s not an ordinary thing to undertake while most will be sunning themselves on a beach somewhere outside of the UK.<br/><br/><b>So while you are sitting at home at 9am next Saturday having breakfast spare a thought for us as we start this epic challenge.  Then spare another thought on the Sunday morning when you wake up for a relaxing day as WE'LL STILL BE WALKING! . And while you’re sparing that thought maybe you could spare a few pounds as well</b>.<br/><br/>When you donate you'll be playing a part in raising more than £1.5m for Oxfam - and the Gurkha Welfare Trust – through the Trailwalker challenge. Just to put some perspective on where your money will be going:<br/><br/>- £25 could boost the income and improve the diet of an Ethiopian family by providing them with a sheep or goat<br/><br/>- £43 could provide a month’s welfare pension for a deserving old Gurkha in Nepal<br/><br/>- £100 could buy a bed for a pensioner in the Oxfam Residential Home<br/><br/>- £142 could install a water pump and irrigation system for farmers in Rwanda<br/><br/>And when we reach our target of £2,000 we will have raised enough to rebuild two Gurkha’s homes in Nepal.<br/><br/>So come on guys, dig deep and donate now.

The walk is 192 miles and we will be living off ration packs as well as a nibble of the fine lembas bread before leave. Each night we will camp and tell tales, we will walk amongst the animals and fly amongst the birds (we have no fear).

It’s very likely that we’ll walk through the night (with little or no sleep) until the end. The event raises vital funds for Oxfam and The Gurkha Welfare Trust. The Gurkha welfare trust is a charity that provides financial, medical and community aid to ex-Gurkha servicemen and their communities in Nepal.<br /><br />My team ""GasPanic"" is hoping to raise funds to help some of the world’s poorest people. Our fundraising campaign will also enable Oxfam to respond immediately to emergencies around the world, as well as to fight poverty at its roots by campaigning  against injustice and empowering people with life-changing projects. <br /><br />On a personal note my dad (Gurkha Major Karnasher Tamang) had taken part in the first ever trailwalker here in the UK (as he was the Gurkha Major at that time) he made it happen bringing the event from Hong Kong... <br /><br />So this is personal as I need to beat his time!!! Haha <br /><br />So please help it’s for a good cause... raising funds for our Gurkha Veterans (Gurkha Welfare Trust)...<br /><br />My Trailwalker team members and I will be going the distance and we hope that you can support us in this massive challenge. Please consider how you may be able to get behind us, either by donating us or sharing our journey with your contacts in social media.  If you would like to support us then please find more information about our goals and activities on this page and where to donate for this good cause.<br /><br />100 km is a long way to walk!  But putting ourselves through months of intense training will be worth it for the impact our fundraising has on others through Oxfam & The Gurkha Welfare trust. Your support is what will take me and my teammates over that finish line.<br /><br />We ask you to please give generously and consider that your donation will make a real difference. <br /><br />Thank you!<br /><br /><br />Kabir<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br />Thanks for taking the time to visit my JustGiving page.",Kabir's Trailwalker Page,42.50,0,522.30,104,0,https://images.justgiving.com/image/8fab63e6-081c-4b33-9f6f-694b8d171bb7.jpg,https://images.justgiving.com/image/8fab63e6-081c-4b33-9f6f-694b8d171bb7.jpg?template=size150x150face,NA,NA,NA,NA,Raising money for Gurkha Welfare Trust,Raising money for Gurkha Welfare Trust,NA,GasPanic,NA,NA,NA,Trailwalker 2018,https://www.justgiving.com/Kabir-Tamang1,/Kabir-Tamang1,United Kingdom,...<strong>Oxfam</strong>...,Kabir's Trailwalker Page,//images.justgiving.com/image/trainer-no-branding_web.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true&sourcepath=Stock,Fundraiser,2.1606693,Kabir Tamang,2018-06-16T21:46:27,13441,4447644,2018-07-13T00:00:00,500,5703514,Raising money for Gurkha Welfare Trust,,Oxfam,202918,2018-08-05T09:18:09Z

However, they had not served the 15 years needed to qualify for an Army Pension.<br/>Unlike their British counterparts who could rely on the Welfare State in old age, the Nepali Gurkhas had no such safety net.<br/><br/>Nepal remains one of the poorest countries in the world, with limited industry, agriculture and infrastructure.<br/>It suffers from a complex terrain and climate, with frequent natural disasters. It also lacks effective public services or social welfare systems.<br/>Today, the Trust provides financial, medical and development aid to Gurkha veterans, their families and communities.<br/>Its support is critical for ex-servicemen and their dependants, who are often unable to work through age, illness or injury.

Like everyone, I was shocked by the revelations about abuse committed by former members of the charity in Haiti and other countries, and I believe that the charity could have done more at the time to investigate the individuals. However, my faith in Oxfam as a force for good in the world is unshaken. They are the largest, and by many measures the most effective development NGO in the world. Their projects have a positive impact on millions of lives across dozens of countries. T<span>hese are the people who will suffer as Oxfam loses considerable amounts of its funding. </span></p><p>I've been in training for the past 2 months, cycling c. 50 miles a week to work and back with a few long rides out of London. I'm aiming to raise £200 and to complete the course in 7 hrs (averaging approx 15 mph). I've raised £100 already with a world cup sweepstake and a bake sale at work. Thank you so much to those of you who've already supported me and been out with me on my training rides!</p><p>Those of you who'd like to track me on the day, you can do so here using my name or bib number (15377) - http://results.prudentialridelondon.co.uk/2017/?pid=tracking</p><p>Thanks so much for reading, stay tuned for more before race day!

Its going to be Hilarious!! </p><p>All four of us are determined and if we can raise some money for both Oxfam and The Gurkha Welfare Trust, so that they can help support some of the worlds poorest people, here in the UK and abroad, then those blisters will be very worthwhile.</p><p>For £14 Oxfam can provide shelter in a crisis</p><p>£20 can build a compost toilet in a community, helping to prevent the spread of disease.</p><p>£1 can provide drinking water for 10 people</p><p>The Gurkha Welfare Trust provide pensions for veterans who aren’t entitled to a standard army pension, medical care and also community aid.</p><p>Anything you can give to these great causes, would be brilliant.

Many of these soldiers had served alongside Britain in the Second World War and other conflicts; however they had not served the 15 years needed to qualify for an army pension.<br /><br />For almost 50 years the Trust has provided welfare to enable these Gurkha veterans, their dependants and their communities to live their lives with dignity.

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Without eyesight I can only imagine how someone would feel... Angry, Devastated, Afraid, Frustrated, Isolated, Alone, Different, Lost, Confused.... These are just a few of the many emotions blind people and their parents feel when their child is diagnosed with a lifelong eye condition.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The beauty of this world is felt by the heart but seen by eyes. I believe no-one should be denied this independence, this basic human sense or jewel of the body, if something can be done to rectify it.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">“There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle” and I believe that every dream can come true with hard work and determination. My name is Sehrish Zafar and I am an entertainment journalist and a TV Presenter. I understand it is not easy to encourage people to think optimistically, so that's where my charismatic personality and charm can help inspire people to make a difference in the society.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I am currently a freelance TV Presenter for various UK asian channels; I host at many stage events: fashion, charity, political and award ceremonies especially within our community. I am a graduate of BA Business Management and an award holder of 'Miss Perfect' at college.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Other achievements include fundraising for charities like Save the Children, Ucare Foundation; working as an Events Director of Pakistan Youth Foundation - Organised dinner events for Pakistani politicians, protests against Burma and Gaza Killings, promoted local community cultural music events, visited House of Commons and Pakistan High Commission on many occasions to support our community.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">As I have selflessly helped support the dreams of others and those of my community, I hope I will continue to receive the help and support I seek to fundraise for those in need the most. I am fasting in aid of Sightsavers and your generous support in this great cause will aid me to do more for the ones who need the help most. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Sightsavers believes that no one should be blind from avoidable causes, and that people’s whose sight can’t be saved should live with dignity and independence.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>Did you know?</strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">There are 39 million blind people in the world</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">80% of blindness can be prevented or cured</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Around 90% of visually impaired people live in the world’s poorest countries</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">So the problems Sightsavers are trying to tackle are pretty enormous.</p>

However, if left untreated it causes scarring to the eyelid that makes the eyelashes turn inward, and with every blink they scrape against the eye. This causes intense pain, and over time, blindness.<br/><br/>Trachoma has been eliminated in many parts of the world, so the plan is to wipe it out in the 43 countries that still count trachoma as a public health problem.<br/><br/>To raise money to fight trachoma, I am going to try and run non-stop for 24 hours at the Cotswold 24 hour race:</p><p><span>https://www.100milerun.com/cotswold-24-hour-race/<br/></span></p><p><span>Any distance over 52 miles will be a new personal best for me, but my goal is to run 100 miles or more.

I realised how lucky I was to have the choice and money to just make a decision and go to have the treatment unlike many others who have to live with their vision impairment.</span></p><p><span>When I read about A Million Miracles I felt the need to help as much as I could. Sightsavers work is very inspiring.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>My Coast to Coast walk was an organised group that I joined with my friend Elizabeth. There were 14 of us in all and we soon became very good friends spending 14 days walking and chatting about anything and everything to while away the long hours across the Lake District, Yorkshire Dales and North York Moors. It was during these chats that 2 people, separate of each other suggested I take up running. I poo pooed them and said I had never even run across the road for a bus and there was no way I could go running but it stuck with me and I kept thinking about it.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>When I got home I felt physically and mentally strong after walking 192 miles even though my feet felt like horse’s hooves.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>I decided not to let the strength disappear and so I downloaded the app, Couch to 5K, and tentatively started the first 1 minute run that nearly killed me. Soon I was running a bit more every week and eventually I reached the 5K (30 minutes) and I cried. Not from pain but from the sense of achievement.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>I quickly decided to down load the app 5k-10k and set off to double my distance over a period of months. Eventually cracking the 10K distance.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>At this point I didn’t know if I should continue as I was worried I was too old and would destroy my knees. But my sensible head went out of the window as I downloaded the app 10K-21K and started to work towards the half marathon. I live in Ealing and there is a very good half marathon every year in September which goes right past the front of my house. I usually go out every year to clap the runners past, never dreaming that I would ever be able to do such a thing. (As of September 24th 2017 I have now completed that half marathon in 2 hours and 8 minutes and am very happy with that time for my first effort.)</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>I then received an email from Margaret (one of the ladies who was on the coast to Coast walk) to say that her friend Karen was going to be running in the London Marathon in April 2017 for charity and would we consider sponsoring her. Karen was very special to us, she was not just any old friend of Margaret, she went out of her way to drive across the UK with a box of homemade chocolate brownies and a bottle of fizz for us all on our last day. She met us in a small village about 2 hours walk from Robin Hood’s Bay (our final destination) with the brownies to share out amongst us to give us all a chocolate boost and then drove on to Robin Hood’s Bay with the fizz and shared it all out with a glass for each of us to celebrate our wonderful achievement as we dipped our toes in the water. What a wonderful friend.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>Of course, I sponsored Karen, after all, one good turn deserves another even after one and a half years had gone by. I then spent all of Sunday morning trying to spot her on TV in the marathon. It was at this point that I decided I could do this. I could run that marathon too as I watched everyone running the course. So here I am with a place and am absolutely </span>petrified<span>, what have I done? But I WILL do this and hope to raise a good sum for Sightsavers and all those eyesights that will be restored to people who have lost hope.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>I hated sports at school and was always useless. Sports day was my biggest nightmare as I ran around hurdles and under the high jump and would hide in the toilets. Who would think that in my 60th year I would attempt to do such a thing as run the London marathon? I wish my teachers could see me now.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>Last year I ran in my first ever race, the Osterley 10K. it was 26 degrees that morning but I completed it in literally seconds over the hour and I was the proud owner of my first ever running medal. (I went to bed in it that night and woke up with the medal part under my armpit ) I have since hung it up to remind me of what i can achieve when I decide to do something. My Ealing Half marathon was run in 20 degrees and full sunshine but I completed it and now have a second medal which I also wore to bed that night!! I can feel a tradition starting here.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>At the beginning of February I also completed, with a personal best of 57 minutes, the London Winter 10k run with 20,000 other people, starting in Trafalgar Square and running basically to St Paul's and back round the streets of London. It was freezing cold but so much fun and honestly, I felt like I would have liked to turn round and do it all again when I got to the end. I wanted to experience what it was like to run with so many people in London before the big MARATHON day.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>I have now completed the hottest London marathon on record, 24.1 degrees officially, in a time I am really chuffed with, 4:59:17, a fraction under the 5 hour mark. It was challenging and hot but I was well trained (I had run 419 miles during the previous 5 months), well fuelled thanks to my lovely Craig and well hydrated due to no alcohol at all for at least a month before. I felt strong and determined and when it got tough around 23-24 miles I gave myself a good talking to and ran on to get over the line in just under the 5 hours which was my aim. </span></p><p class=""p1""><span>I love my medal, its heavy and bears all the weight of the effort involved to obtain it. I will never forget that day for the rest of my life, I ran with a massive smile most of the way. Apologies in advance if you still see me wearing my medal now and again but I am chuffed to bits with it :)</span></p><p class=""p1"">I am now an official marathoner at the age of 59 and a half!!! xxx</p><p class=""p1""><span>I wrote a blog about my Coast to Coast walk if you want to read about my effort.

Mariyah was diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma, an extremely aggressive form of cancer at the age of 7 and a half and engaged in a battle with it up until the age of 16, where she endured a plethora of treatments including chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery in both conventional and experimental variations. She was subjected to an overwhelming bombardment of hardship, pain and suffering throughout her years but despite that she continued to plough on with her strong character, will and determination. </p><p><span>The tumour originated in her femur and then continued to grow and metastasise around her body but she continued to fight it at every step of its progression. She endured inhumane amounts of pain, sickness and suffering caused by combination of the disease and the side effects of the rudimentary treatments that exist today. These did not phase her up until December 2016 when she was experiencing severe headaches and blurry vision and we were told that the cancer had metastasised</span><span> into her brain which is extremely rare for her form and that it was applying pressure to her eyes, thus distorting her vision. She underwent radiotherapy which was unsuccessful and we were not able to contain the tumour within her. It continued to </span><span>colonise</span><span> her brain and eventually it grew on her optic nerves and she effectively lost her vision. </span></p><p><span>Mariyah had endured every side effect and possible manifestation of pain but it did not defeat her, however when she lost her eyesight, she was </span><span>absolutely</span><span> </span><span>distraught. Her character had changed, her will wasted away and she began to lose herself and eventually so would we. For Mariyah, her vision was her connection to the outside world, even when she was cornered by the unstoppable forces of nature within her, it allowed her to see the comforting smile of her parents faces or even the photos that would evoke her favourite memories that would provide her with the hope and thus determination to fight; however when this connection was severed she was defeated as she entered the dark abyss of the end of her life. </span><br/></p><p><span>Sadly, she lost her battle on the 19th of April 2017. However, before she had passed she had heard about Sighsavers and their pledge to treat blind children and restore their vision by removing their cataracts. When she heard that it would only cost £4 per eye, she immediately wanted to contribute to restore the vision of as many children as she could as she was enraged that it could be done so easily</span><span>. Even though she knew that her vision could not be restored, she wanted to impact the lives of those that could be treated as she had endured </span>their pain. She wanted to add this extremely personal pledge to her portfolio of charitable work but unfortunately she was not able to do so. Therefore, we would like to carry out Mariyah's wish to pledge and continue her profound impact on this planet by giving the gift of sight. </p>",Fundraising in loving memory of Mariyah Jasrai,1652.50,0,11003,110,0,NA,NA,443883,Mariyah Jasrai,/b83e9729/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/9935335,remember/443883,I am fundraising because I would like to restore the eyesight of 2500 kids.,I am fundraising,I would like to restore the eyesight of 2500 kids.,NA,NA,NA,NA,In memory of Mariyah Jasrai,https://www.justgiving.com/Sofian-Jasrai,/Sofian-Jasrai,United Kingdom,...<strong>Sightsavers</strong>...,Fundraising in loving memory of Mariyah Jasrai,//images.justgiving.com/image/ca556780-635e-476e-9cd9-1e00c1692d99.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,2.112562,Sofian Jasrai,2017-04-26T22:04:24,179,4210958,2017-04-26T22:04:24,10000,12271,I am fundraising,I would like to restore the eyesight of 2500 kids.,Sightsavers,207544,2018-08-05T09:18:09Z

She gave to dozens of charities, worked in a charity shop for years, and organized the Red Cross charity flag sellers in her parish for 30 years, all unpaid and out of the goodness of her large heart. </p><p><span>But Sightsavers was especially close to that heart, the one cause above all others that she wanted to support. For her, blindness was the most terrible of afflictions, and Sightsavers' mission to eliminate avoidable blindness and to make the world a fairer place for people with such disabilities was something that deserved the widest possible support.</span><br/></p><p>And while she loved flowers, she always thought it wrong that money would be lavished on flowers for a funeral (which wouldn't benefit the deceased), when it could be spent to much better effect and benefit far more by being given to a good cause such as Sightsavers.<br/><br/>Phoebe was not a great one for computers, always preferring handwritten letters, phone calls and face-to-face contact, but she diligently attended a computer class for years, learning (just about) how to read and write emails. She was a great pragmatist, however, and she did accept that, even if it was all gobbledygook to her, the internet could be harnessed for good purposes. Hence this page – and the comparable one for her late, much missed husband Dick (https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/richardwoollcombe) in aid of the Alzheimer's Society – had her blessing, in the hopes that it would help her precious cause of Sightsavers. </p><p>So, whether you knew Phoebe and want to give something in her memory, or whether you think Sightsavers is an admirable cause and deserves support, thank you for whatever you can give.</p><p>PS  Why is this page called Phoebe's Online Egg Round? Simple: as anyone who lived near her will know, once a week she would go round the local village selling eggs from her hens to friends and neighbours. She always called this her egg round, and it became very much a social event, with her driving home full to the gills after 15 cups of tea and endless chat. She also milked it for all she was worth when she was selling flags for the Red Cross. This page is very much in the same shameless spirit, hence the name!</p><p><span>Finally, here's the official blurb:</span></p><p><span>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

My name is Shirley and I'm a 23 year old girl from London! In October of this year I took a trip to Ghana with my mum, to visit family, as we hadn't been back there in so long! It's such a wonderful place and I enjoyed my time there! But during my last few days, I contracted Malaria. It sort of crept up on me as I didn't even come across any mosquito bites, and I was taking anti-malarial tablets. I remember sitting with my family at an event, and feeling a little ill, and so I excused myself to the restroom, and I guess that's when the symptoms started. I was sick and felt so weak. When I explained this to my mum, and told her that I felt feverish (hot one minute, cold the next), she immediatly took me to the hospital. I saw the doctor and took some tests, and the results came back positive for malaria. I remember thinking, why me? Lucky for me, my mum was quick to make the decision to take me to the doctor. I recieved a few injections and medicine, and was told to finish the course of medicine over the following days. I was due to travel back to the UK that same day, and even though I was dreading the long plane ride, I just wanted to be home. It wasn't a pleasant journey as I cried half of the time, but when I got home, my mum put me in bed, and I was comfortable enough to rest. I was in bed for a whole week, but thankfully I recovered fully after that.</p>
<p>I can say that I am very fortunate to have been through that and recover, as some people aren't as lucky.</p>
<p>Malaria is a serious but preventable and treatable disease, but it claims the life of a child every minute. However, serious malaria cases can be reduced by providing mosquito nets, tests and medicines.</p>
<p>That's where a charity like Malaria No More UK comes in. I came across them and was very impressed with the work that they do to help people who may not have access to treatment or preventable measures for Malaria.</p>
<p>So I wanted to raise as much money as I could, with the help of my friends on the internet, to donate to their cause. If you're here reading this, thank you for visiting this page. And if you feel compelled to give, even as little as £1, I know that it would go a long way, and eventually help those people in need.</p>
<p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure. Your details are safe with JustGiving – they’ll never sell them on or send unwanted emails.

<p>CARE fights poverty and injustice in 86 countries around the world to help the world’s poorest people find routes out of poverty. CARE also delivers emergency aid to survivors of war and natural disasters, and helps people rebuild their lives in the aftermath.</p>
<p>CARE’s mission is to create lasting change in poor communities and put money where it is needed most: 94 pence in every £1 goes towards our poverty fighting programmes. That’s one of the highest rates among all the UK aid agencies.</p>
<p>We particularly like the work of Care International because its work ranges from providing education and shelter through to providing medicine- it is not restricted to one type of support. Additionally, it is not prejudiced in the type of people it helps; regardless of sex, race, gender, and religion it aims to help all those in extreme poverty.</p>
<p>We are particularly interested in the work that they are currently doing for Syrian refugees. The Syrian crisis is worsening day by day and I think its paramount that individuals and charities do all that they can to alleviate the suffering experienced. We also think that their work for one-off crisis' such as the Phillipines hurricane is significant; providing humanitarian aid quickly and efficiently for events such as these, is paramount to saving lives.</p>
<p>Your donations will go to those in need of education and to programmes helping small businesses, so communities can, in the long term, can get on their own feet. They will also go to those needing medication, water and shelter supplies so that in the short term suffering and poverty can be diminished. We also think that the way they work with businesses and Governments ensure that you donations definitely go to the right places.</p>
