Here we will collect and test drive our very own tuk tuk. We will then be driving approximately 3500km down to Cochin in the south of India over a two week period. Yes people, that means we will be travelling over 200km a day in a lawnmower with a cruising speed of 30mph!!   <br/><br/>There will be no route, no back-up and no way of knowing whether we're going to make it! We will most certainly get lost, break down, catch 'delhi belly' and hopefully help save a bit of the world whilst doing it with your generosity.<br/><br/>The charity:</p><p><span>Our chosen charity is Cool Earth. Cool Earth work with rainforest communities to help halt the destruction of rainforests and climate change.

<p>My name is Tino. I'm going to be 4 on the 24th May. I love presents but I love animals even more. Especially those living in the rainforest. My favourite animals are the Hyacinth Macaw and the Toco Toucan.  But I love so many - the Andean cock-of-the rock, the emerald tree boa, jaguars, anacondas, hornbills, ring-tailed lemurs and fossas to name just a few.  I've seen many of them in the zoo, but one day I would like to see them in the wild, in the rainforest. </p>
<p>We have a book in school, called The Rainforest. It has all my favourite animals, but it also tells about how people are cutting more and more trees in the rainforest and the animals are losing their home. Without a home, the animals will disappear. Will the rainforest be there when I'm grown up? Will I be able to see the macaws and all the other rainforest animals? I hope so...</p>
<p>I'm small still but I want to help the rainforest. I'm having a party for my birthday and have invited my friends. There are always many presents at birthdays. I'm fortunate enough that I will have lots of lovely presents from my family. So I'm asking my friends, instead of giving me presents, to help me help the rainforest.</p>
<p>Cool Earth is a charity that works with local communities to protect the rainforest from being cut down. This impacts many things like climate change, local community welfare, and biodiversity which I hope to understand better as I grow up.

I wanted to know which charity does the most good in terms of lives saved or improved for every pound it receives. Eventually, I came across </span><a href=""http://www.givewell.org"">www.givewell.org</a><span>, a non-profit organisation that evaluates charities to identify those that do the greatest good. They assess and report on each charities evidence of effectiveness, transparency and cost-effectiveness to make peoples donations go further. Each year, they publish a list of their top-rated charities.</span></p><p>On this list was Malaria Consortium, a world leading non-profit organisations specialising in the prevention, control and treatment of malaria and other communicable diseases among vulnerable populations.</p><p>Current statistics from the World Health Organisation estimate that 445,000 people die as consequence of malaria each year. In 2015, 303,000 children died before their firth birthday. It is estimated that malaria kills one child dies every minute. I find these horrifying statistics incomprehensible in this day and age but unfortunately, they are accurate. There is strong evidence that seasonal malaria chemoprevention provided by the Malaria Consortium substantially reduces cases of malaria.</p><p>Please help me to raise some money for this incredibly worthy cause.</p><p>Thank you very much</p><p>Issa</p><p>If you would like further information, please visit:</p><p><a href=""https://www.givewell.org/charities/malaria-consortium"">https://www.givewell.org/charities/malaria-consortium</a></p><p><a href=""http://www.malariaconsortium.org"">http://www.malariaconsortium.org</a></p><p><a href=""http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs094/en/"">http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs094/en/</a></p><p><a href=""http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/malaria/en/"">http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/malaria/en/</a></p>",Issa runs Paris Marathon to help Malaria Consortium,122.50,0,627.94,314,0,Paris Marathon because nearly half of the world's population is at risk,Paris Marathon,nearly half of the world's population is at risk,true,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Paris Marathon 2018,https://www.justgiving.com/Issa-Salem,/Issa-Salem,United Kingdom,...Issa runs Paris Marathon to help <strong>Malaria</strong> <strong>Consortium</strong>...,Issa runs Paris Marathon to help Malaria Consortium,//images.justgiving.com/image/626e0214-a325-4d3f-9dc5-dba449c72b3e.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,19.867773,Issa Salem,2018-03-15T20:34:50,181721,4193387,2018-04-08T00:00:00,200,183804,Paris Marathon,nearly half of the world's population is at risk,Malaria Consortium,181721,2018-05-23T15:36:15Z

Refugees are fleeing away from their unstable countries to seek for asylum, they are in need for survival kits and health treatments. So, I’m planning to start a charity drive to help them as much as I possibly could.

So, I would like to take this opportunity to personally invite anyone of you who are reading this post to contribute a part of your value for the cause. </span><br/></p><div><b>This is the least thing I could do to pay my contribution to the world. </b><span>Even though my graphic design service could not help directly in terms giving aid or manpower, but I’ve always wanted to contribute some portion of my services for charity. So, this is my way to be the part of making others living their best life in this world. My goal is to raise as much as possible for the charity drive by raising my service standards to the best quality as possible.</span><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><b>What inspires me to do the charity drive</b> is by looking inspiring from big entrepreneurs out there giving away their life and money to help others. Bill Gates is one of the people I am inspired by, whom donated most of his wealth for charity reasons around the globe. I do realize that I’m not that so called a big company to donate most of my wealth to charity. But I believe that with every small step I’ve made, I could make a difference in someone’s life. <br/><br/>I chose Oxfam as my charity platform because they are doing a great job on giving aids to the needs out there in all around the world. Oxfam is a movement of millions of people, all working towards one goal – an end to poverty for everyone. I believe on what they believed, “In a world rich in resources, poverty isn’t inevitable.” I feel that I’m not the one whom need the most from the resources, so I think I should give my part to someone who need it the most. Oxfam believe that everyone should be able to eat, drink, earn and learn as much as we do. </div><div><br/>T<b>hrough Oxfam and their partners, 4.3 million people got access to clean water, 2 million people got food, cash or vouchers to survive a crisis, and 1.7 million women were supported to exercise their rights. </b>They couldn't have done it without someone like us. </div><div><br/>On average for every £1 donated to Oxfam, they invest 84p on their humanitarian, development and campaigning work. They invest 8p to raise further funds, and they invest 8p on support and running costs such as paying the salaries of staff who work all year round to deliver their work and who ensure they are effective and accountable.</div><div><br/>To conclude and to mention it again, the idea behind the charity drive is to cut off 20% from every income I’ve received from my graphic design service and donating them to charity. So, obviously, the more I get, the more I will give in return and more people I could contribute to. This is my goal. All donation will go straight to my profile at JustGiving.com and will be donated to Oxfam. </div><div><br/>Thank you for all you support!</div><div><br/>Regards,</div><div>Azri Omar<br/><p><span> </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span></span></p><p></p></div>",Ahmad Azri's Charity for Oxfam,0,0,0,0,0,I am raising money because I believe everyone deserves equal benefits.,I am raising money,I believe everyone deserves equal benefits.,true,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Charity for Oxfam,https://www.justgiving.com/Azri-Omar,/Azri-Omar,United Kingdom,...Ahmad Azri's Charity for <strong>Oxfam</strong>...,Ahmad Azri's Charity for Oxfam,//images.justgiving.com/image/36eaf3af-c3b7-4dfa-984d-f5af9531aaae.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,8.653474,Ahmad Azri Omar,2015-12-08T19:35:41,13441,3129090,2015-12-08T19:35:41,500,15524,I am raising money,I believe everyone deserves equal benefits.,Oxfam,13441,2018-05-23T15:36:15Z

By continuing to support Oxfam, we can push Oxfam to set a gold standard in safe guarding, and best practices in vulnerable situations to ensure this never happens again. We don’t need Oxfam just for the charity it can give, we need Oxfam for it’s unique position it now finds itself in to drive real change.<br/><br/>3)    The horrendous actions of the minority shouldn’t punish the good work of the majority<br/><br/>9 people have been accused of sexual misconduct out of a global organisation of 10,000 employees.

We are a team of four women who are willing to undertake the endurance of the 100K Oxfam TrailWalker Challenge through the South Downs from the Queen Elizabeth County Park in Hampshire, starting at 6am on the 14 July to trek day and night non-stop until we reach Brighton! The event is timed and we plan to finish in sub-24 hours so we can be in Brighton for breakfast! </p><p>This will be the ultimate challenge for our team as we have never undergone an ultra before! Made up of runners, hikers, trailwalkers and cyclists, though our outdoor activity styles are different we all share a love of a challenge and a passion for life. This challenge will definitely be our toughest to date but we are excited to be part of it and work to become Trailwalker Legends!! To hike, walk and run solid for 24 hours will test us to our limits of mental and physical strength. The route was set by The Gurka Signals over 30 years ago as the ultimate test of teamwork and endurance for new recruits with a total ascent of 2,500m - the equivalent of Ben Nevis and Snowdonia combined - this will be no walk in the park. To achieve this challenge we will be training for months to make sure we are Trailwalker fit and to make you all an Oxfam proud!</p><p>For more information about the challenge check out Oxfam's website https://www.oxfam.org.uk/Trailwalker.

Training has begun in earnest and to save the ears of my fellow team members from my grumbles and groans on the way round, I will be putting a vast ""Rocky training"" play list together!<br /><br />Now for the dough.... there will be many of you I am sure who would pay good money to see the Tyneside Rejects and the Lady go through this pain. I am pretty sure I won't be looking much like a lady by the end of it! Thankfully it will be dark!  ANY donations that you are able to give will be gratefully received and hugely appreciated.<br /><br />Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

Oxfam is a charity which I’m very happy to support, as it continues to do fantastic work in many of the world’s poorest countries, whilst the Gurkha Welfare Trust operates in Nepal in the verypoor communities which suffered greatly in the earthquake a few years ago.

Trailwalker is a great way in which to challenge yourself individually and also help Oxfam get more pennies in, to support the less fortunate. So please sponsor me guys and help me reach our team target of £1400!!! xx</p><p><b>PHIL</b> - Some of you may be aware that for several years now I have been constantly over weight and this is my way to focus and kick start the rest of my life as a slimmer person. Trailwalker is the biggest challenge by far that I have ever undertaken and will help so many other people by helping myself. Please help me raise money to reach our team target of £1400 it would be great to exceed this. Please dig deep and sponsor me so that we can help support the less fortunate.</p><p><b>PAUL</b> - I am doing trailwalker to challenge myself and raise money for  charity in the process. We are aiming for £1400 as a team effort so please donate to this worthy cause.</p><p><b>ZOE</b> - I'm doing this challenge to help and support people in need. I feel Oxfam on the whole does a great job around the world,  I would love to see them in action. It would be great to help re-build lively hoods after day to day crisis, this is my way of giving and challenging myself at the same time and as a way to up my fitness. This is going to be a hard challenge mentally and physically, but very rewarding. Please sponsor me to help us raise our team target of £1400.</p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

If you're not familiar with this charity, a little background story to who and what the Gurkha's are:</p><p>The Gurkhas are soldiers from Nepal who are recruited into the British Army, and have been for the last 200 years. Gurkhas are known to be as fearless in combat as they are good natured in daily life.<br/></p><p>Roughly 19,000 Gurkha soldiers have died during the many wars they've fought at Britain's side. Many thousands more have been wounded, and more still have returned to a life of hardship in Nepal. <br/></p><p>The Gurkha Welfare Trust provides medical, financial and development aid to Gurkha veterans, their families and their communities. More information can be found on the website at https://www.gwt.org.uk</p><p>The challenge itself is taking place on a 100km route across the South Downs from 13-15 July with a team of 4 of us aiming to finish this monster walk! It's quite easy to underestimate what walking 100km (60 miles) entails. Having just completed our first 30 mile training walk I can tell you that it's a lot of blisters, sore knees and stiff hips! Add in to the mix the element of sleep deprivation from walking right through the night and the fact that we'll have to do double the distance of our longest walk so far.. you start to see that this will be no walk in the park. To put it another way, we'll be walking the distance of 2.3 marathons over terrain with the equivalent elevation of climbing Ben Nevis.. twice.</p><p>Any contribution you can make to this great charity is most welcomed, thanks for reading.</p><p>Arron</p><p><span><i>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

<p>I started to feel that what I was doing wasn't enough, I wanted to make a contribution to the organisation that would really make a difference... and then I had an idea.</p>
<p>What if I got the Oxfam logo permanently tattooed on my arm?! Well, I'm up for the commitment but I'm going to need some fantastic support from you guys to do it.

And I know it is even more central  going forward.  The irony is that Oxfam is a rare organisation that tries to challenge the deep-rooted barriers women face, such as discriminatory attitudes and violence.  In my own team, we work on projects that support women small scale farmers and shrimp producers with their production and their leadership roles, and also work to challenge social norms that undervalue the unpaid care that women do, or keep them out of economic opportunity.  </p><p>Next time around, I will revert to raising funds for deafness or other causes outside of my day job, but this year is a time for solidarity with Oxfam and the people it is helping day by day.</p><p><span>UPDATE MAY 7th</span></p><p><span>It's done!   Gloriously sunny but hot.

It was also one of the fastest, but with a mix of fast and plodding stretches.  After endless prep, 2 hours at the pool waiting to start, it was all done and dusted in less than an hour and a half.</span></p><p>Thank you everyone SO much for your support.  I knew on Saturday when I started wondering 'why did I sign up for this' that with so much support there was no question of wobbling.   Your contributions to Oxfam are hugely appreciated and will go to fund very necessary work.</p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>The small print</span></p><p><span>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

I have found running is something that I’ve been able to continue as I get older and, when my wife went through the experience of cancer diagnosis and treatment in 2012, it provided a good therapy for me. It was a time and space to think, pray and sometimes shout (much to the interest of guided busway passengers).

I am also very aware of all my patients and the different, challenging and also difficult journeys that we have been making together these past years.<br/></p><p>In recognition of all of this I will be running the Marathon in May. Though I have promised to do it without the shouting! </p><p>So why Oxfam? </p><p>Well, initial links are that we have donated to Oxfam as a charity for some years and that my daughter volunteers in one of the Oxfam<br/>shops in town. But more than that this last year we have been made aware of poverty and injustice more than ever and Oxfam is passionate about tackling that everywhere. Something I hadn’t been aware of is that money raised may be supporting people here in the UK as well as in countries like Ethiopia or Haiti. That global approach is something I wanted to get behind.</p><p>I would be so pleased if you could get behind me as I train and run for Oxfam. If you could donate something that would be great. If you can keep an eye on my page and maybe send me a message to encourage my training that would be great too. <span> </span>Now we see if the doctor can practise what he sometimes preaches! </p><p>Thank you for reading this! </p><p>Julian. </p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

My three teammates, myself and many others will have to run, jog or walk 100KM in under 30 hours between 13-15th July.  <br /> <br />The reason I have chosen to undertake this challenge this year to support Oxfam and The Gurkha Welfare Trust is because, I want to be able to help the many           ex-Gurkhas and their widows, living back home in Nepal, that still live in poverty. I served under the British Army as a Gurkha soldier for 20 years and this year I want to help give back to the community that I grew up in. Growing up in a rural village in Nepal I experienced the difficulties of poverty, and so I understand how important charities like Oxfam and The Gurkha Welfare Trust are; how big of an impact they can make in a small community.<br /> <br />Oxfam and The Gurkha Welfare Trust provide remote villages in Nepal with:<br />- Financial aid such as welfare pension for ex-Gurkhas and their widows (approximately £70 per month) to buy basic necessities such as food<br />- Medical aid which has helped over10,000 individuals last year alone<br />- Water and sanitation that helped bring clean water to more then 21,000 people last year<br />- School programmes which benefited around 40,000 children living in poverty last year<br /> <br />You can help support me today by donating to my page.

Kits include water purification tablets, safe water storage, cups and soap.</p><p>***THE CHALLENGE***</p><p>Most of the team know we can complete the walk, it may have been the hardest thing we've ever done and we may have cried alot (and there's every chance Liz may be rubbish) but this year we ask for your wonderful generosity in sponsoring us not just to finish the race but to complete it in less than a day which will involve a hardcore mental attitude, Yasmin marching us from the front and possibly some running. </p><p>You can follow our journey on Instagram and Facebook @blistersbeforemisters</p><p>For corporate sponsorship and all Mister applications please email blistersbeforemisters@hotmail.com</p><span class=""white-trans"" style=""width: 960px;height: 44px;""></span></div></div><div id=""fundraising-amount"" class=""aside"" style=""float: right;width: 300px;""><div id=""thermometer"" class=""frp-thermometer"" style=""float: right;height: 200px;width: 250px;color: rgb(28, 28, 28);""><div class=""base"" style=""float: right;height: 202px;width: 202px;""><span style=""height: 38.5px;width: 180px;"">Raised:</span><strong style=""color: white;text-align: center;width: 160px;""><em>10%</em></strong></div><em class=""empty-class""> </em></div><div id=""donation-info"" style=""color: rgb(42, 66, 198);""><p>Team target:<span> </span><strong>£1,400.00</strong></p><p>Raised so far:<span> </span><strong>£140.00</strong></p></div><div id=""sharing"" style=""color: rgb(28, 28, 28);""><span class=""share-button"" style=""width: 50px;float: left;""><span style=""text-align: justify;width: 51px;height: 40px;""><!--EndFragment--><br/></span></span></div></div><p><br/></p><p></p>",Liz's page,32.50,0,130,30,0,NA,NA,NA,true,NA,BlistersBeforeMisters,NA,NA,NA,Trailwalker 2018,https://www.justgiving.com/Liz-Williamson6,/Liz-Williamson6,United Kingdom,...<strong>Oxfam</strong>...,Liz's page,//images.justgiving.com/image/8d3fc8cc-7591-417d-a75e-5d1d69f0fee6.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,2.3097003,Liz Williamson,2018-04-25T19:46:37,13441,4447644,2018-07-13T00:00:00,430,5703514,NA,NA,Oxfam,13441,2018-05-23T15:36:15Z

It is one of the world's leading providers of humanitarian aid in emergencies with recognised technical expertise in clean water, public health, food security and the protection of civilians. When an emergency happens, Oxfam are there to respond. Right now, Oxfam are responding. And we couldn't do it without the vital funds from incredible supporters like you.<br /><br />The second charity I’ll be raising money for is The Ghurka Welfare Trust. Established in 1969, The Gurkha Welfare Trust exists to ensure that Gurkha veterans, their widows, and their wider communities are able to live with dignity in Nepal. They achieve this primarily through the provision of financial, medical, and community aid.<br /><br />These charities are providing provisions around the world which are helping the families and individuals who are in dire need of support.

The Oxfam Trailwalker begins at Queen Elizabeth Country Park passes through stunning but challenging terrain of South Downs National Park and finishes at Brighton Racecourse.<br/><br/>Teams of four enter this event and have 30 hours to walk or run the 100 km trail, although our team is hoping to finish within 20 hours.  It’s very likely that we’ll walk through the night (with little or no sleep) until the end. The event raises vital funds for Oxfam and The Gurkha Welfare Trust. The Gurkha welfare trust is a charity that provides financial, medical and community aid to ex-Gurkha servicemen and their communities in Nepal.<br/><br/>My team &#34;GasPanic&#34; is hoping to raise funds to help some of the world’s poorest people. Our fundraising campaign will also enable Oxfam to respond immediately to emergencies around the world, as well as to fight poverty at its roots by campaigning  against injustice and empowering people with life-changing projects. <br/><br/>My Trailwalker team members and I will be going the distance and we hope that you can support us in this massive challenge. Please consider how you may be able to get behind us, either by donating us or sharing our journey with your contacts in social media.  If you would like to support us then please find more information about our goals and activities on this page and where to donate for this good cause.<br/><br/>100 km is a long way to walk!  But putting ourselves through months of intense training will be worth it for the impact our fundraising has on others through Oxfam &amp; The Gurkha Welfare trust. Your support is what will take me and my teammates over that finish line.<br/><br/>We ask you to please give generously and consider that your donation will make a real difference. <br/><br/>Thank you!<br/><br/>Sushant<br/><br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Thanks for taking the time to visit my JustGiving page.<br/><br/>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Without eyesight I can only imagine how someone would feel... Angry, Devastated, Afraid, Frustrated, Isolated, Alone, Different, Lost, Confused.... These are just a few of the many emotions blind people and their parents feel when their child is diagnosed with a lifelong eye condition.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The beauty of this world is felt by the heart but seen by eyes. I believe no-one should be denied this independence, this basic human sense or jewel of the body, if something can be done to rectify it.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">“There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle” and I believe that every dream can come true with hard work and determination. My name is Sehrish Zafar and I am an entertainment journalist and a TV Presenter. I understand it is not easy to encourage people to think optimistically, so that's where my charismatic personality and charm can help inspire people to make a difference in the society.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I am currently a freelance TV Presenter for various UK asian channels; I host at many stage events: fashion, charity, political and award ceremonies especially within our community. I am a graduate of BA Business Management and an award holder of 'Miss Perfect' at college.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Other achievements include fundraising for charities like Save the Children, Ucare Foundation; working as an Events Director of Pakistan Youth Foundation - Organised dinner events for Pakistani politicians, protests against Burma and Gaza Killings, promoted local community cultural music events, visited House of Commons and Pakistan High Commission on many occasions to support our community.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">As I have selflessly helped support the dreams of others and those of my community, I hope I will continue to receive the help and support I seek to fundraise for those in need the most. I am fasting in aid of Sightsavers and your generous support in this great cause will aid me to do more for the ones who need the help most. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Sightsavers believes that no one should be blind from avoidable causes, and that people’s whose sight can’t be saved should live with dignity and independence.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>Did you know?</strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">There are 39 million blind people in the world</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">80% of blindness can be prevented or cured</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Around 90% of visually impaired people live in the world’s poorest countries</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">So the problems Sightsavers are trying to tackle are pretty enormous.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>So please dig deep and donate now.</strong></p>

This is a visual field loss on the same side of both eyes. In my case it was caused by a stroke. Dispite this happening I still finished college and continued working with the support of my family and friends. It has had a huge impact on my life, i won't ever be able to drive although before being diagnosed I wasn't aware of how serious my sight loss was I had taken lessons and failed my practical test 6 times! Yes how embarrassing lol. My stroke was a silent stroke it could have happened at any time. 6 years later leading us to now I have a heart monitor implant because I randomly black out. So this is just a little way of helping others.</p><p>Although my sight cannot be regained there are people who are struggling with sight loss daily who can actually be helped. </p><p>All I ask is for people to donate as little as a £1 to help save someone's sight.  </p><p>£12 - could protect 35 families from river blindness a year!</p><p> £28 - Could pay for a  cataract operation and give someone their sight back! </p><p>£140 - Could treat and protect an entire village from trachoma! </p><p>Just a few examples of what your money could be doing.

There were 14 of us in all and we soon became very good friends spending 14 days walking and chatting about anything and everything to while away the long hours across the Lake District, Yorkshire Dales and North York Moors. It was during these chats that 2 people, separate of each other suggested I take up running. I poo pooed them and said I had never even run across the road for a bus and there was no way I could go running but it stuck with me and I kept thinking about it.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>When I got home I felt physically and mentally strong after walking 192 miles even though my feet felt like horse’s hooves.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>I decided not to let the strength disappear and so I downloaded the app, Couch to 5K, and tentatively started the first 1 minute run that nearly killed me. Soon I was running a bit more every week and eventually I reached the 5K (30 minutes) and I cried. Not from pain but from the sense of achievement.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>I quickly decided to down load the app 5k-10k and set off to double my distance over a period of months. Eventually cracking the 10K distance.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>At this point I didn’t know if I should continue as I was worried I was too old and would destroy my knees. But my sensible head went out of the window as I downloaded the app 10K-21K and started to work towards the half marathon. I live in Ealing and there is a very good half marathon every year in September which goes right past the front of my house. I usually go out every year to clap the runners past, never dreaming that I would ever be able to do such a thing. (As of September 24th 2017 I have now completed that half marathon in 2 hours and 8 minutes and am very happy with that time for my first effort.)</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>I then received an email from Margaret (one of the ladies who was on the coast to Coast walk) to say that her friend Karen was going to be running in the London Marathon in April 2017 for charity and would we consider sponsoring her. Karen was very special to us, she was not just any old friend of Margaret, she went out of her way to drive across the UK with a box of homemade chocolate brownies and a bottle of fizz for us all on our last day. She met us in a small village about 2 hours walk from Robin Hood’s Bay (our final destination) with the brownies to share out amongst us to give us all a chocolate boost and then drove on to Robin Hood’s Bay with the fizz and shared it all out with a glass for each of us to celebrate our wonderful achievement as we dipped our toes in the water. What a wonderful friend.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>Of course, I sponsored Karen, after all, one good turn deserves another even after one and a half years had gone by. I then spent all of Sunday morning trying to spot her on TV in the marathon. It was at this point that I decided I could do this. I could run that marathon too as I watched everyone running the course. So here I am with a place and am absolutely </span>petrified<span>, what have I done? But I WILL do this and hope to raise a good sum for Sightsavers and all those eyesights that will be restored to people who have lost hope.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>I hated sports at school and was always useless. Sports day was my biggest nightmare as I ran around hurdles and under the high jump and would hide in the toilets. Who would think that in my 60th year I would attempt to do such a thing as run the London marathon? I wish my teachers could see me now.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>Last year I ran in my first ever race, the Osterley 10K. it was 26 degrees that morning but I completed it in literally seconds over the hour and I was the proud owner of my first ever running medal. (I went to bed in it that night and woke up with the medal part under my armpit ) I have since hung it up to remind me of what i can achieve when I decide to do something. My Ealing Half marathon was run in 20 degrees and full sunshine but I completed it and now have a second medal which I also wore to bed that night!! I can feel a tradition starting here.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>At the beginning of February I also completed, with a personal best of 57 minutes, the London Winter 10k run with 20,000 other people, starting in Trafalgar Square and running basically to St Paul's and back round the streets of London. It was freezing cold but so much fun and honestly, I felt like I would have liked to turn round and do it all again when I got to the end. I wanted to experience what it was like to run with so many people in London before the big MARATHON day.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>I have now completed the hottest London marathon on record, 24.1 degrees officially, in a time I am really chuffed with, 4:59:17, a fraction under the 5 hour mark. It was challenging and hot but I was well trained (I had run 419 miles during the previous 5 months), well fuelled thanks to my lovely Craig and well hydrated due to no alcohol at all for at least a month before. I felt strong and determined and when it got tough around 23-24 miles I gave myself a good talking to and ran on to get over the line in just under the 5 hours which was my aim. </span></p><p class=""p1""><span>I love my medal, its heavy and bears all the weight of the effort involved to obtain it. I will never forget that day for the rest of my life, I ran with a massive smile most of the way. Apologies in advance if you still see me wearing my medal now and again but I am chuffed to bits with it :)</span></p><p class=""p1"">I am now an official marathoner at the age of 59 and a half!!! xxx</p><p class=""p1""><span>I wrote a blog about my Coast to Coast walk if you want to read about my effort. How did I know that it would be the start of something much larger?</span></p><p class=""p1""><a href=""http://lozandherboots.blogspot.co.uk/"">http://lozandherboots.blogspot.co.uk/</a></p><p class=""p1""><span>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

A few months ago I went one better and benefitted from the incredible technology of Laser Eye Surgery. Within 3 days I was deemed legal to drive without visual aid (pretty hard to comprehend when you've lived through -8.5).<br/><br/>Wearing glasses wasn't an issue (unsurprisingly I was used to it), but I always felt vulnerable to any situation in which they could be ripped away. In an emergency my confidence and independence would instantly be gone. And yet too many people don't even have the privilege of a simple pair of glasses or access to the everyday eye care that we can take for granted.

Mariyah was diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma, an extremely aggressive form of cancer at the age of 7 and a half and engaged in a battle with it up until the age of 16, where she endured a plethora of treatments including chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery in both conventional and experimental variations. She was subjected to an overwhelming bombardment of hardship, pain and suffering throughout her years but despite that she continued to plough on with her strong character, will and determination. </p><p><span>The tumour originated in her femur and then continued to grow and metastasise around her body but she continued to fight it at every step of its progression. She endured inhumane amounts of pain, sickness and suffering caused by combination of the disease and the side effects of the rudimentary treatments that exist today. These did not phase her up until December 2016 when she was experiencing severe headaches and blurry vision and we were told that the cancer had metastasised</span><span> into her brain which is extremely rare for her form and that it was applying pressure to her eyes, thus distorting her vision. She underwent radiotherapy which was unsuccessful and we were not able to contain the tumour within her. It continued to </span><span>colonise</span><span> her brain and eventually it grew on her optic nerves and she effectively lost her vision. </span></p><p><span>Mariyah had endured every side effect and possible manifestation of pain but it did not defeat her, however when she lost her eyesight, she was </span><span>absolutely</span><span> </span><span>distraught. Her character had changed, her will wasted away and she began to lose herself and eventually so would we. For Mariyah, her vision was her connection to the outside world, even when she was cornered by the unstoppable forces of nature within her, it allowed her to see the comforting smile of her parents faces or even the photos that would evoke her favourite memories that would provide her with the hope and thus determination to fight; however when this connection was severed she was defeated as she entered the dark abyss of the end of her life. </span><br/></p><p><span>Sadly, she lost her battle on the 19th of April 2017. However, before she had passed she had heard about Sighsavers and their pledge to treat blind children and restore their vision by removing their cataracts. When she heard that it would only cost £4 per eye, she immediately wanted to contribute to restore the vision of as many children as she could as she was enraged that it could be done so easily</span><span>. Even though she knew that her vision could not be restored, she wanted to impact the lives of those that could be treated as she had endured </span>their pain. She wanted to add this extremely personal pledge to her portfolio of charitable work but unfortunately she was not able to do so. Therefore, we would like to carry out Mariyah's wish to pledge and continue her profound impact on this planet by giving the gift of sight. </p>",Fundraising in loving memory of Mariyah Jasrai,1583.75,0,10680,107,0,I am fundraising because I would like to restore the eyesight of 2500 kids.,I am fundraising,I would like to restore the eyesight of 2500 kids.,NA,Mariyah Jasrai,NA,NA,NA,NA,In memory of Mariyah Jasrai,https://www.justgiving.com/Sofian-Jasrai,/Sofian-Jasrai,United Kingdom,...<strong>Sightsavers</strong>...,Fundraising in loving memory of Mariyah Jasrai,//images.justgiving.com/image/ca556780-635e-476e-9cd9-1e00c1692d99.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,2.3588457,Sofian Jasrai,2017-04-26T22:04:24,179,4210958,2017-04-26T22:04:24,10000,12271,I am fundraising,I would like to restore the eyesight of 2500 kids.,Sightsavers,179,2018-05-23T15:36:15Z

She gave to dozens of charities, worked in a charity shop for years, and organized the Red Cross charity flag sellers in her parish for 30 years, all unpaid and out of the goodness of her large heart. </p><p><span>But Sightsavers was especially close to that heart, the one cause above all others that she wanted to support. For her, blindness was the most terrible of afflictions, and Sightsavers' mission to eliminate avoidable blindness and to make the world a fairer place for people with such disabilities was something that deserved the widest possible support.</span><br/></p><p>And while she loved flowers, she always thought it wrong that money would be lavished on flowers for a funeral (which wouldn't benefit the deceased), when it could be spent to much better effect and benefit far more by being given to a good cause such as Sightsavers.<br/><br/>Phoebe was not a great one for computers, always preferring handwritten letters, phone calls and face-to-face contact, but she diligently attended a computer class for years, learning (just about) how to read and write emails. She was a great pragmatist, however, and she did accept that, even if it was all gobbledygook to her, the internet could be harnessed for good purposes. Hence this page – and the comparable one for her late, much missed husband Dick (https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/richardwoollcombe) in aid of the Alzheimer's Society – had her blessing, in the hopes that it would help her precious cause of Sightsavers. </p><p>So, whether you knew Phoebe and want to give something in her memory, or whether you think Sightsavers is an admirable cause and deserves support, thank you for whatever you can give.</p><p>PS  Why is this page called Phoebe's Online Egg Round? Simple: as anyone who lived near her will know, once a week she would go round the local village selling eggs from her hens to friends and neighbours. She always called this her egg round, and it became very much a social event, with her driving home full to the gills after 15 cups of tea and endless chat. She also milked it for all she was worth when she was selling flags for the Red Cross. This page is very much in the same shameless spirit, hence the name!</p><p><span>Finally, here's the official blurb:</span></p><p><span>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

We wanted to use this opportunity to help support the charity Sightsavers and all the great work they do.</p><p>80 per cent of blindness could be prevented or cured which means there are 31.2 million people in the world who are blind when it could have been avoided. &nbsp;Most of these people live in the poorest countries in the world where healthcare is limited, diseases which were wiped out decades ago in the UK still prevail and there is huge stigma around disease and disability. &nbsp;</p><p>Sightsavers do great work supporting their partners to carry out millions of eye examinations and refer people for treatment to prevent blindness and restore sight. Through community volunteers in developing countries, they enable the distribution of medication to prevent blinding diseases, fund operations for people who need them, and train eye care workers and surgeons.</p><p>Because of Sightsavers, people who are visually impaired or have other disabilities are supported to live independently, get an education and earn an income. &nbsp;They work with national governments, strengthening systems that tackle the problems at the root of avoidable blindness – like access to clean water, sanitation facilities and education.</p><p>Their goal is to bring about long-term change – making health systems stronger, educating communities and fighting for people with disabilities to be treated equally</p><p>Your donation could restore someone’s sight, prevent avoidable blindness or support someone who’s irreversibly blind to live independently. &nbsp;Here's just a few examples of where the money will go:</p><p></p><ul><li><span style=""word-spacing: normal;"">£4- Cataract operation to give a child back their sight</span><br></li><li><span style=""word-spacing: normal;"">£8 - Trachoma operation to stop 12 people going blind</span><br></li><li><span style=""word-spacing: normal;"">£12 - Treatment to prevent 2,184 losing their sight to river blindness</span><br></li></ul><p></p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

Traveleyes, which provides multi-sensory group holidays for both blind
and sighted travellers, was telling me about the 10th anniversary plans for his
company (actually, he was trying to flog me a ticket to the ball, but when I
heard about the plans for the charity abseil, I jumped in as the first volunteer). &nbsp;<span style=""word-spacing: normal;"">I've jumped from a plane at 15,000 feet, surely stepping off
the Armouries can't be that scary, right?!</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Amar is blind himself and never lets it stand in his
way.&nbsp; Just one of the things he's done is
a 220 mile trek from the Atlantic to the Pacific Coast of Nicaragua.&nbsp; He and other blind and partially sighted
friends inspire me and show that we can achieve anything we put our minds to! &nbsp;There are some cases
where sight can be saved though and this is why I’d like to raise funds for
Sightsavers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Opposite my gran’s house in
Delhi, India, was an Institution for the Blind. &nbsp;My parents always took some form of donation when we visited, so I’ve seen first-hand how even simple procedures can restore sight.</p><p>

We couldn't really afford it and it seemed strange to be thinking of Christmas on a beautiful sunny day in spring but we got him anyway. We had just had coffee in Saint Mark's Square and were&nbsp;incredibly happy...</p><p>My husband and I have since separated&nbsp;and this&nbsp;lead me to question whether the Santa would be a&nbsp;source of&nbsp;sadness and&nbsp;irritation or whether it would remind me of a&nbsp;lovely memory. I decided that it had to be the latter and&nbsp;also to appreciate the little things at Christmas that I have&nbsp;so easily taken for granted in the past. As I continued decorating the tree, I realised that the&nbsp;<em>sights</em> of Christmas are so important and that vision (at all times of the year) makes a massive contribution as to how we interpret and experience the world and the joy we take from living.</p><p>On the Sightsavers website I learnt that: <em>there are 39 million blind people in the world, 80% of blindness can be prevented or cured and 90% of visually impaired people live in the world's poorest countries.</em> The idea of 'baubles for the blind' popped into my&nbsp;head and the concept that&nbsp;people&nbsp;could post the sights of Christmas that are uniquely theirs and part of their history but then donate a small amount to a charity where just £4 will fund a cataract operation and give a child back their sight, £8 provides a trachoma operation to stop 12 people going blind and £12 can prevent 2184 people losing their sight to river blindness...</p><p>Unlike most fundraising ideas however, 'Giving the gift of sight' will only work if everyone joins in! I had the idea but really after I have posted&nbsp;my story&nbsp;and photos&nbsp;(and got the ball rolling) it will be out of my hands what happens. I do not need to train for&nbsp;weeks to complete some impressive physical feat, bake cakes or buy expensive equipment. Also, there is no guarantee that anyone will post a picture or that those who do&nbsp;will then follow the link and give any money. My idea then rests on trust, it relies on goodwill and has at its heart a&nbsp;wish to make a small but significant difference. if this brings a positive change and can help one person, I will be happy and so, of course, will they...</p><p>For more information go to: <a href=""http://www.sightsavers.net/"">http://www.sightsavers.net/</a></p><p>Thanks for taking the time to visit my JustGiving page.</p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.
