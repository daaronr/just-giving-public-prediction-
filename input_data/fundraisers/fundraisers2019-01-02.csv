&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m twelve years old and have battled through Anorexia, Depression and&amp;nbsp;OCD for the past year. And it was only after a disturbing and gut-wrenching wake up call in the form of a geography lesson that I fully began to realise the extent of poverty and its devastating effects, and I felt so guilty that I had so much food and water and was wasting it, when thousands and thousands of people world&amp;nbsp;wide are dying from starvation and lack of clean water through no choice of their own. So, I did some research and found that around&amp;nbsp;5000 children die every day from lack of clean water!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have decided to make a change, to make a difference, to raise some much needed money to change the lives of those who need it. So please, dig deep and help me&amp;nbsp;to raise&amp;nbsp;some money. Donate only what you can afford... big or small - every little helps! A measly &amp;pound;5 could buy a bag of cement to build a hand dug latrine in places like Nigeria, and &amp;pound;60 could buy a hand dug rope pump to provide an entire&amp;nbsp;village with a lifelong supply of clean water!!&lt;/p&gt;

<p class=""MsoNormal""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">More on why I’m doing this…</span></strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In June this year I embarked on a Raleigh ICS expedition to Mgongo Village in Tanzania, Africa for 10 weeks to address issues relating to water and sanitation. Our team of 6 international volunteers, 5 in-country volunteers and our 2 team leaders started by conducting action research in several sub-villages in the surrounding area. We surveyed houses and schools, and gathered information regarding health and sanitation in their daily lives, looking into how they collect and use water, what diseases they get regularly and much more. We analysed all the data in order to gain greater understanding as to what the key issues were and based our later campaigns on the results.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In our later campaigns:</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">We helped in the construction of latrines in a primary school.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">We provided schools with hand washing devices and workshops on hand hygiene.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">We taught communities and schools about HIV/AIDS and how to prevent them.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">We started up a community women’s group.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Even though me and my group accomplished so much, there is much more that we didn’t get to accomplish. We were overwhelmed by issues and that’s in one small village in the whole wide world.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">That’s why I’m still trying.</p>

<p>Sam and I have decided to take a risk and not play hockey on a Saturday for once and instead raise some money for a great cause whilst trying to have a bit of fun at the same time. </p>
<p>Jailbreak is an event that occurs in Universities all over Britain, where students aim to get as far away from the Uni (square) as possible in 48 hours without using any money. Apart from buying food. And water... </p>
<p>This year, UEA is raising money for WaterAid. An International Charity, WaterAid's goal is to transform lives by improving access to safe water, hygiene and sanitation. WaterAid aided almost an extra 200,000 people in 2012-2013 from the previous year, reaching roughly 1.7million with clean water. From studying International Development, I know WaterAid attempts to use low-cost, sustainable and community-led initiatives, as well as connecting with governments in an attempt to help them pursue national-level programmes. </p>
<p>Both Sam and I would be hugely greatful if you could donate any money towards our target, no matter how small you may think it is. If we reach our target, I am sure Sam and I will think of some interesting photos and challenges to do on the way. </p>
<p>Thank you so much for taking time to donate and read this. </p>

<p>I'm 40 this year, and am sick of receiving mugs, aftershave, socks, and other shit for birthdays / Xmas. As such, if you normally give me a present, why not donate to my chosen charity, WaterAid instead? At first glance it may just appear to be a new name for sparkling water, like lemonade or orangeade, but I think there's more to it than that. I can't be arsed explaining it, so see the link instead. I've tried adding proper links to this page twice but given up, it's total wank. </p>
<p>Obviously, I do loads of stuff for charity, but I just don't like talking about it. This is all a bit embarrassing for me, perhaps publicising what a charitable legend I really am. I'm sorry this has become public knowledge, but it saves one person receiving an unwanted present for their birthday (ie me), it's worth every penny.</p>

A lot of children can't go to school because they have to spend their day finding clean water; this means that they can't have a proper education and get a good job. Most children get ill because of the dirty water they are drinking which gives them diseases so they can't live a long and happy life like all of us can. By donating some money would be helping the people have long and healthy lives with a lot more clean water.</p><p>I have chosen this charity because an important part of the story I will read on my Batmitzvah is about giving water to a thirsty servant and his camels. The servant has to chose a wife for his masters son. The wife will be the one who will offer to draw water for the camels and the servant.</p><p>Just have a think, are you kind enough to give someone a glass of water or let them use your toilet?

For WaterAid, I aim to complete a 3,500 mile solo-row across the North Atlantic Ocean from New York to Lochinver (North West Scotland), in a self-built, clinker style skiff converted for ocean rowing. </b><br/><br/>After years of researching and pondering over the idea, I have finally come to the conclusion that I'm not getting any younger, so now is the time to put 'pen to paper' or in this case 'oar to water'!<br/><br/>I've been building the boat, at my home, for the past year, as cost effectively as humanly possible - it's been a real labour of love. It is now complete, only the last remaining safety gear and fittings to go. I am beyond excited about this project – as are my friends and family – because my ultimate aim is to raise significant funds for the internationally recognised and respected company, WaterAid. I have been corresponding with WaterAid management/administration - they have been enthusiastic throughout and are keen to see this fundraiser go ahead. This is where you may be able to help!<br/><br/>During the last few months I have been making a huge effort to attract sponsors – individuals, businesses and other organisations. I am passionate about and committed to this challenge – this reflects my feelings for and belief in the amazing work of WaterAid – something I think I might share with you.  I hope that you will consider helping me to meet my challenge and, so, contribute to WaterAid’s invaluable ongoing efforts.<br/><br/>I will start the challenge in May 2018 in New York and hope to arrive at Lochinver Harbour 90-100 days later. In the meantime there is much to be done: completion of the boat, testing equipment, fitness training, navigation study etc. This is a heads-up to anyone who would like to follow my progress and wants to offer any support, in the form of donation, time or spreading the word - please share!<br/><br/><b>FACEBOOK:</b> <i><u>https://www.facebook.com/duncanadrift/</u></i></span></p><p><span><b>WEBSITE: </b><i><u>https://duncanadrift.com</u></i></span></p><p><span><b>NORTHERN TIMES FRONT PAGE FEATURE: </b></span><u><i>https://www.northern-times.co.uk/News/Lochinver-man-to-row-the-Atlantic-19102017.htm</i></u></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>Thanks for reading, it's greatly appreciated.<br/><br/>Duncan </span><br/></p><!--EndFragment-->",NA,Duncan Adrift,4785.75,0,29088.93,0,0,NA,NA,https://images.justgiving.com/image/8348f413-2416-456c-8daf-06278938f27c.jpg,https://images.justgiving.com/image/8348f413-2416-456c-8daf-06278938f27c.jpg?template=size150x150face,"its a great charity, transforming lives every day.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Atlantic Row,https://www.justgiving.com/duncanhutchison,/duncanhutchison,United Kingdom,,Duncan Adrift,//images.justgiving.com/image/ba938369-cdc6-4d96-8f5e-66c1ba7f7277.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,7.708209,Duncan Hutchison,2015-07-20T14:51:53,54697,2737563,2016-05-16T00:00:00,0,56780,Rowing across The Atlantic in my self-built skiff,"its a great charity, transforming lives every day.",WaterAid,288701,2019-01-02T17:40:43Z

The original aim was to encourage as many people as possible to make a small donation every time they have a spa or beauty treatment. In addition, we've got people involved in a WELLness Walk, the first was on 7th May in Altrincham . The response was fantastic, 50 people came on the walk. Everyone raised money and we're hoping the total will help Wateraid fund at least 40 wells - all in one day, which is a-maze-ing!!  Hopefully it will become an annual event as the feedback has been so positive with everyone loving the chance to get out in the fresh air (and sunshine!) catch up with friends and raise money for such a worthwhile cause.The benefit of our project is that whilst you're looking after your own health and wellness, YOU are providing clean water for those in real need across the globe. Together we can fund the building of wells for those that are dying from unclean water.....it gives real meaning to the terms 'WELLness' and 'WELLbeing'. Imagine what we could achieve if we all encouraged our friends to donate -  we could actually save lives. If you make a donation to help people in need,  this act of genuine kindness can give you an ''inner glow' , which in turn can enhance the feeling of well-being. As a result, you should get much more from your treatment ( ... or walk!) The more you look after yourself, the more you help those in genuine need, a 'Give back and GLOW' approach. Also, if you comment on how good the spa /salon was,  we can spread the word, promote the establishment and enhance the industry.... so everyone does WELL, a real win/win/win! ...or Well, Well, Well ! ( sorry!) <br/><br/>The facts - 650 million people live without safe water. Every day 1400 children die from diarrhoea caused by unsafe water and poor sanitation, that's over 500, 000 each year .....and we are so lucky to have enough clean water that we can swim in it!  <br/>A while ago I remember seeing a cartoon where a little boy from a third world country looks on incredulously at a child from the developed world, and says ....'....so your water is so clean, that you poo in it ? ? ( ...or words to that effect !) ...it sounds crazy that the water we flush in our toilets is much, much cleaner than the water many people drink each day. Also, when we visit a spa we are so lucky to be able to bathe, swim, float, exercise and relax in water that is sparkling clean, whereas millions of people are drinking unsafe water and dying as a result. It really hit home that it's such an unequal, unfair world, and that if possible, we should be doing all we can to improve this dire situation - to prevent 1400 children dying unnecessarily today.  Because the spa industry is based around the health-giving benefits of water, I felt that WaterAid was the perfect charity partner, and together we could all make a difference in the world, whilst enhancing our own WELLness  and that of our clients. True WELLbeing in action.  <br/><br/>To make it really quick and simple - download the Justgiving App, then it's simply a few taps (taps!) to donate ...don't forget to tell us how wonderful the spa/salon/therapist was and tick the gift aid box so we raise even more ....thank you! <br/><br/>(Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

During this past week I've been thinking of all the wonderful people who have made a positive impact on my life, feeling grateful for the many blessings that I have, for my amazing family, my husband and sweet precious children.. And I've thought, as a great number of you live all around the world, how do I have a party to celebrate and say thank you for what you've meant in my life? <br/><br/>So I've decided not to have a party, but rather to celebrate life by raising money for a charity close to my heart..but now which one would that be? I could choose one that relates to my beloved parents who died way too young..my Dad aged 52 due to mental illness, so do I choose a charity that supports people with that disease? Or a cancer charity, given that my Mum died of colon cancer aged 58 and that I have so many friends and family who have won or lost the battle? Or do I choose a charity that supports vulnerable children as I am eternally grateful that I have three healthy and happy children? It would also need to be an international charity..so that it's relevant to all of you, in your own part of the world and so that you know that you ARE making a difference by donating. <br/><br/>Today I came across an article that I could barely read through my tears.. Seven pregnant woman, profiled by the international charity WaterAid, revealed the &#34;essentials&#34; they will pack in their &#34;hospital bag&#34;, things that they will need during labour.. The lady from New York packed a Bose music player, eye mask and coconut massage oil, and spoke of how new life is a true miracle, about wanting the best for your baby and how it's devastating to think about dangers such as contaminated water and unhygienic facilities; a lady from Malawi packed a razor blade and string to cut and tie her own umbilical cord and a black plastic bag to put over the hospital bed, knowing that there is no clean running water and that the bed would not have been cleaned from the previous delivery; a lady from Melbourne, originally from the UK and who lived in Malawi for 2 years, had the most kitted out and well organised bag, and said how she thought it was unbelievable that heavily pregnant women are collecting dirty water themselves, carrying 25 litres over a considerable distance; the lady from London packed Haribo sweets, mini iPad and an empty water bottle, and said she's assuming the hospital will have a water fountain where she can fill it. Another lady, from Tanzania packed a (dirty) plastic basin for her to wash herself after the birth..none of the rooms in the labour ward have basins or any provision of water..women have to wash in the toilet or climb into the sink in the sluice room to wash after giving birth. Sitting in the comfort of my home and remembering the awesome experience of the birth of my babies, it was horrific to read the raw truth of just how very different the delivery of new life happens in different places around the world. <br/><br/>I then went onto the WaterAid website to read more about its DELIVER LIFE appeal. And I read another horrific thing: Every minute a newborn baby dies from an infection caused by a lack of safe water and unclean environment.. Can you believe that that happens? Every minute!<br/><br/>So my chosen charity, to celebrate the 40th year of my life, is WaterAid, and in particular its DELIVER LIFE appeal..through our donations we can support the delivery of the most basic need that a new life should have access to..and that is clean water. <br/>The DELIVER LIFE appeal's strap line is Deliver Hope, Deliver Joy, Deliver Life. Those of you who know me well will know that in the last couple of years, I've been so grateful for renewed Joy and Hope in my life which has helped me cope with the loss of my parents. I think my parents would approve of my choice of charity!<br/><br/>Please help me make a difference by donating to WaterAid. I've set a target of £4,000 (can you see the &#34;40&#34; in there!) And I'm going to kick off the donations with what we could've spent on a party here in Edinburgh and that has the number 4 in it.. It would be awesome if you could donate any amount that includes the number 4 in it. Donating through the JustGiving website is so easy and you'd be donating in your local currency, any amount will make a difference. <br/>And, to make our donations reach even more mums and babies, the UK Government has pledged that until 10 February (ha, 4 days before my birthday!) it will match every £ donated by us to WaterAid..so NOW is the time to give! <br/><br/>God bless you all and thank you so very much - for your donation of course, and also for your friendships, for the laughs and happy times we've shared together, for the sad ones too, the tears and the sharing of great loss, for your support, encouragement, for your positive affirmation, for the very things I wish I could to turn to my parents for and am blessed to find in you.

Not only do they improve access to water sanitation and hygiene in the short term they also implement community-led solutions to help empower local communities and educate them about the benefits of clean water so that they can continue Water Aid’s work in the long run helping to free themselves from the lives of poverty in which they are trapped. Their target is to give everyone, everywhere, access to clean water by 2030. This will be a huge challenge, but one which we believe to be achievable.<br/></p><p>When considering poverty in the developing world, many people feel deep sorrow but conclude that there is nothing we can do. While poverty is indeed extreme and wide- spread, it is easy to forget just how many people there are in the developed world, and how powerful our pocket change can become when pooled together. <br/></p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

I will be donating my cut hair to the Little Princess Trust, who provide real hair wigs, free of charge, to boys and girls across the UK and Ireland that have lost their own hair through cancer treatment.</p><p>I want to give my hair to help make these wigs but also to raise money by asking people to sponsor me to grow my hair so long and have it cut in one of our school assemblies, just before I go to Ardroy Outdoor Education Centre in March.</p><p>I intend to split any money I raise between the Little Princess Trust, Ardroy and another charity we have been learning about at School, Water aid. I have set myself a target of £150 to start.</p><p>The Little Princess Trust is a children’s cancer charity and our mission is to supply real hair wigs to children suffering with cancer, for the duration of their treatment.  However, in addition we assist children with other conditions which also result in hair loss, the most common being alopecia.  Our commitment to these children is different.  Despite being set up to help children with cancer, the Trust is able to supply children that do not have a cancer diagnosis with a single wig.  Whilst we are unable to commit to supplying more than one wig, we hope that this gesture will help the child and family whilst they decide on their long-term plans for dealing with this sort of condition.</p><p>Ardroy Outdoor Education Centre is a multi-activity residential facility situated in Lochgoilhead, Scotland. We have been in operation since 1969, and can accommodate over 70 people. We run school, youth, adult courses, and more!<br/>Most attendees are primary school children - we work with local authorities across Scotland and beyond. Youth groups, colleges, charities, and businesses use our services too. We also work with adult groups, whether for leisure or learning. Our activities achieve a range of learning outcomes, in particular those set out for school pupils in the Curriculum for Excellence.</p><p>WaterAid help the world’s poorest communities to transform their lives with clean water.1 in 10 people don’t have access to safe water and 1 in 3 don’t have access to a decent toilet.

After we received the horrible news that Maurice had suddenly passed along with Killian and the time came to close his bank account, we discovered that he had been paying monthly to this fantastic charity. Although it was obvious to everyone that knew Maurice that he was a kind and generous person, even we found it very touching that at 19 years of age,  being considered a bit of a party animal and someone who thought money would burn in his pocket, that he was considerate enough to do this and never say a word to anyone about it. It was just one of the kind and considerate thing Maurice done on a daily basis and it is because of this we want to raise this money in his memory. We are having a Night at the Races in his memory for this charity too, which will be held at Fintona Golf Club on 15th April. Everyone is more than welcome and every penny is greatly appreciated.

My dad died young, he was only 49 when he died from Cancer in 2008. It's been a hard 10 years dealing with the loss. So, I want to turn something bad into something good and mark 10 years with a year of positive change - I'm running in his memory...for a whole year!  <br/><br/>My Confirmed Runs (so far) are: <br/><br/><strong>- 24/06/2018: Heaton Park 10K  - Completed <br/>- 08/07/2018: We Love Manchester 10K - Completed<br/>- 18/08/2018: Mix Tape Virtual 5K <br/>- 09/09/2018: Salford 10K <br/>- 23/09/2018: 20 Miles of Summer Virtual <br/>- 14/10/2018: Manchester Half Marathon <br/>- 27/10/2018: Glow In The Park 5K <br/>- 25/11/2018: Wilmslow Festive 10K <br/>- 08/12/2018: Completed It Mate Virtual 10K <br/>- 07/04/2019: Manchester Marathon </strong><br/><br/>I have paid for all these runs myself and have not taken charity spaces. I would really appreciate your donations to WaterAid if you would like to contribute and celebrate my dad's memory.<br/><br/>So why WaterAid?<br/>844 million people living without clean water and 2.3 billion people not having a decent toilet shouldn’t be normal. Thanks to remarkable people donating WaterAid have already made huge progress. But there’s still so much more we need to do.

Tragically, it is not normal in a huge part of our world. Mothers have to take themselves, often substantial distances to give birth, collecting and carrying water for their own birthing. Those who manage the work of reaching a clinic, carrying their water, may face giving birth on soiled sheets, the use of unwashed instruments and generally far from hygeinic conditions.  After birth, mothers must choose either to let babies die of dehydration u nder hot sun, or risk babies' lives by hydrating them with dirty water. Children collect water for the family, walking several miles before school, then attending school with no bathrooms, a serious deterrent to school attendance for older children in particular. And so.... Water Aid is present, transforming areas one by one, by the building of water systems, building sanitary provision and teaching hygiene, to establish durable facilities and transform lives for millions, one step at a time.
