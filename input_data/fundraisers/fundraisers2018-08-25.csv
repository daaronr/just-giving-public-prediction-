The Rickshaw Run is easily the least sensible thing to do with two weeks&#34;<br/><br/>&#34;No set route, no back-up, no way of knowing if you're going to make it. The only certainty is that you will get lost, you will get stuck and you will break down&#34;<br/><br/>&#34;It's just you and your mates in a wholly unsuitable vehicle, traversing the subcontinent enduring whatever s**t the road throws at you&#34;</i><br/><br/>Effectively we're completely unprepared but ready to take on the challenge. To put it into perspective, last year a single team in one rickshaw broke down in excess of 100 times. Exciting Stuff.<br/><br/>Of course, all of this is for a good cause, two good causes in fact. Whilst we will be tearing accross the Indian subcontinent, tempting fate with delhi belly and sleeping in our roadside tent, we will be raising funds going straight to the following worthy causes:<br/><br/><u><b>Cool Earth - https://www.coolearth.org</b></u></p><p style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);""><br/><i>&#34;Cool Earth is an environmental charity that works in partnership with indigenous communities.<br/><br/>The charity only protects rainforest that without intervention will be destroyed within the next 18 months.<br/><br/>Cool Earth works strategically, protecting forest that acts as a barrier to a wider landscape.<br/><br/>The charity spends just 10% of your donation on admin and governance making sure as much as possible goes to project areas.<br/><br/>Through working with local people Cool Earth makes sure conservation goes hand in hand with better livelihoods&#34;.</i><br/><br/><b><u>Great Ormond Street Hospital London - http://www.gosh.org</u></b><br/><br/><i>&#34;Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity raises money to enable the hospital to provide world class care and to pioneer new treatments and cures for childhood illnesses&#34;<br/><br/>&#34;With more than 268,000 patient visits every year, we need your support to help us give hope to our young patients and their families&#34;<br/></i><br/><b>Lets talk donations -<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span><br/>Ideally we're hoping to raise at least a total of £1000 for these great causes.

This is a 10,000 mile trip from London to Mongolia with the finish line in a town called Ulan Ude just North of the Mongolian border. This Mammoth road trip has to be completed in a car that is 1L or less with no off-road adaptations to make the journey easier. The trip will be a challenging but EPIC adventure across deserts, mountain ranges and into totally unfamiliar lands.</p><p>We have chosen to do this trip in support of the Cool Earth. This is the official Mongol Rally charity that works with local communities to save the worlds most at risk rainforests. With the size of rainforests globally decreasing rapidly this is a very worthwhile charity to support. They have already saved areas of rainforest by working closely with the people who live in them which is a new strategy that is proving majorly successful. </p><p>Please help us raise money for this worthwhile charity by donating.

Eventually, I came across </span><a href=""http://www.givewell.org"">www.givewell.org</a><span>, a non-profit organisation that evaluates charities to identify those that do the greatest good. They assess and report on each charities evidence of effectiveness, transparency and cost-effectiveness to make peoples donations go further.

In 2015, 303,000 children died before their firth birthday. It is estimated that malaria kills one child dies every minute. I find these horrifying statistics incomprehensible in this day and age but unfortunately, they are accurate.

As a member of STA UK (Society of Technical Analysts) I will again be taking part in the JPMorgan Corporate Challenge run happening on Thur 05, 2018. <br /><br />This year I took a more “academic approach"" in selecting a global cause that needs our attention (for a great insight check https://80000hours.org) and ended up with... fighting the biggest killer of children in Africa - malaria. <br /><br />Why? Some sad facts:<br /><br />- Malaria kills one child every 30 seconds, about 3000 children every day. Over one million people die from malaria each year, mostly children under five years of age, with 90 per cent of malaria cases occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa (UNICEF, 2003. Yes, the source is old and the situation improved a lot, but you could nevertheless estimate the scale of the problem).<br /><br />- The disease costs the African economy more than $12 billion every year and a slows the economic growth of countries with high malaria rates of 1.3% - it's draining countries, continents and communities. Malaria takes it's toll on the poorest and continues to keep them in a cycle of poverty.<br /><br />The good news is:<br /><br />- Sleeping under insecticide-treated mosquito nets protects against malaria<br /><br />- Early diagnosis and treatment of malaria reduces desease and prevents malaria and an overall situation is improving. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUq0byqxluk&t=10s<br /><br />- BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, by just skipping your next mornings' Starbucks coffee YOU CAN DO GOOD NOW. For just a few dollars, a child is protected with seasonal malaria chemoprevention each year.<br /><br />Many, many thanks to all of you!<br /><br />Regards, <br /><br />Nikolay<br /><br />http://malariaconsortium.org (a charity that I'm supporting that is proven to be able to deliver and be cost-effective)<br /><br />http://80000hours.org (for more inspiration on how to spend your work time with a greater impact)<br /><br />Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure. Your details are safe with JustGiving - they'll never sell them on or send unwanted emails. Once you donate, they'll send your money directly to the charity.

So, I would like to take this opportunity to personally invite anyone of you who are reading this post to contribute a part of your value for the cause. </span><br/></p><div><b>This is the least thing I could do to pay my contribution to the world. </b><span>Even though my graphic design service could not help directly in terms giving aid or manpower, but I’ve always wanted to contribute some portion of my services for charity. So, this is my way to be the part of making others living their best life in this world. My goal is to raise as much as possible for the charity drive by raising my service standards to the best quality as possible.</span><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><b>What inspires me to do the charity drive</b> is by looking inspiring from big entrepreneurs out there giving away their life and money to help others. Bill Gates is one of the people I am inspired by, whom donated most of his wealth for charity reasons around the globe. I do realize that I’m not that so called a big company to donate most of my wealth to charity. But I believe that with every small step I’ve made, I could make a difference in someone’s life. <br/><br/>I chose Oxfam as my charity platform because they are doing a great job on giving aids to the needs out there in all around the world. Oxfam is a movement of millions of people, all working towards one goal – an end to poverty for everyone. I believe on what they believed, “In a world rich in resources, poverty isn’t inevitable.” I feel that I’m not the one whom need the most from the resources, so I think I should give my part to someone who need it the most. Oxfam believe that everyone should be able to eat, drink, earn and learn as much as we do. </div><div><br/>T<b>hrough Oxfam and their partners, 4.3 million people got access to clean water, 2 million people got food, cash or vouchers to survive a crisis, and 1.7 million women were supported to exercise their rights. </b>They couldn't have done it without someone like us. </div><div><br/>On average for every £1 donated to Oxfam, they invest 84p on their humanitarian, development and campaigning work. They invest 8p to raise further funds, and they invest 8p on support and running costs such as paying the salaries of staff who work all year round to deliver their work and who ensure they are effective and accountable.</div><div><br/>To conclude and to mention it again, the idea behind the charity drive is to cut off 20% from every income I’ve received from my graphic design service and donating them to charity. So, obviously, the more I get, the more I will give in return and more people I could contribute to. This is my goal. All donation will go straight to my profile at JustGiving.com and will be donated to Oxfam. </div><div><br/>Thank you for all you support!</div><div><br/>Regards,</div><div>Azri Omar<br/><p><span> </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span></span></p><p></p></div>",Ahmad Azri's Charity for Oxfam,0,0,0,0,0,I am raising money because I believe everyone deserves equal benefits.,I am raising money,I believe everyone deserves equal benefits.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Charity for Oxfam,https://www.justgiving.com/Azri-Omar,/Azri-Omar,United Kingdom,...Ahmad Azri's Charity for <strong>Oxfam</strong>...,Ahmad Azri's Charity for Oxfam,//images.justgiving.com/image/36eaf3af-c3b7-4dfa-984d-f5af9531aaae.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,8.460123,Ahmad Azri Omar,2015-12-08T19:35:41,13441,3129090,2015-12-08T19:35:41,500,15524,I am raising money,I believe everyone deserves equal benefits.,Oxfam,202918,2018-08-25T14:59:14Z

The event is timed and we plan to finish in sub-24 hours so we can be in Brighton for breakfast! </p><p>This will be the ultimate challenge for our team as we have never undergone an ultra before! Made up of runners, hikers, trailwalkers and cyclists, though our outdoor activity styles are different we all share a love of a challenge and a passion for life. This challenge will definitely be our toughest to date but we are excited to be part of it and work to become Trailwalker Legends!! To hike, walk and run solid for 24 hours will test us to our limits of mental and physical strength. The route was set by The Gurka Signals over 30 years ago as the ultimate test of teamwork and endurance for new recruits with a total ascent of 2,500m - the equivalent of Ben Nevis and Snowdonia combined - this will be no walk in the park. To achieve this challenge we will be training for months to make sure we are Trailwalker fit and to make you all an Oxfam proud!</p><p>For more information about the challenge check out Oxfam's website https://www.oxfam.org.uk/Trailwalker.

By continuing to support Oxfam, we can push Oxfam to set a gold standard in safe guarding, and best practices in vulnerable situations to ensure this never happens again. We don’t need Oxfam just for the charity it can give, we need Oxfam for it’s unique position it now finds itself in to drive real change.<br/><br/>3)    The horrendous actions of the minority shouldn’t punish the good work of the majority<br/><br/>9 people have been accused of sexual misconduct out of a global organisation of 10,000 employees.

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Without eyesight I can only imagine how someone would feel... Angry, Devastated, Afraid, Frustrated, Isolated, Alone, Different, Lost, Confused.... These are just a few of the many emotions blind people and their parents feel when their child is diagnosed with a lifelong eye condition.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The beauty of this world is felt by the heart but seen by eyes. I believe no-one should be denied this independence, this basic human sense or jewel of the body, if something can be done to rectify it.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">“There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle” and I believe that every dream can come true with hard work and determination. My name is Sehrish Zafar and I am an entertainment journalist and a TV Presenter. I understand it is not easy to encourage people to think optimistically, so that's where my charismatic personality and charm can help inspire people to make a difference in the society.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I am currently a freelance TV Presenter for various UK asian channels; I host at many stage events: fashion, charity, political and award ceremonies especially within our community. I am a graduate of BA Business Management and an award holder of 'Miss Perfect' at college.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Other achievements include fundraising for charities like Save the Children, Ucare Foundation; working as an Events Director of Pakistan Youth Foundation - Organised dinner events for Pakistani politicians, protests against Burma and Gaza Killings, promoted local community cultural music events, visited House of Commons and Pakistan High Commission on many occasions to support our community.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">As I have selflessly helped support the dreams of others and those of my community, I hope I will continue to receive the help and support I seek to fundraise for those in need the most. I am fasting in aid of Sightsavers and your generous support in this great cause will aid me to do more for the ones who need the help most. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Sightsavers believes that no one should be blind from avoidable causes, and that people’s whose sight can’t be saved should live with dignity and independence.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>Did you know?</strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">There are 39 million blind people in the world</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">80% of blindness can be prevented or cured</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Around 90% of visually impaired people live in the world’s poorest countries</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">So the problems Sightsavers are trying to tackle are pretty enormous.</p>

The race starts at midday on Saturday 4th August and competitors run as many laps of the 9km course (5.6 miles) as they can before midday on Sunday 5th. <br/><br/>I can’t really remember why I ended up doing this race as I don’t really like running, but it had something to do with David Goggins, raising money for Sightsavers (makes doing really stupid events seem less stupid) and finding out if I could actually run 100 miles in 24 hours.<br/><br/>There are many factors that influence the success of a 100-mile run, but I would say that two of the main ones, at least for me, are the course and the weather. The Cotswold 24 Hour Race course is described as “an off-road, 9km mixed course including forest trails and open tarmac paths”. In the world of running, the term “trail” has a pretty broad meaning, encompassing everything from flat, smooth, maintained, wood-chip covered paths, to uneven, off-camber-rock-strewn-pot-holed -ankle-twisting-leg-breaking-unrunnable-mountains. I have a permanent ankle injury (gross instability of the left ankle) so have been advised not to run on uneven surfaces; I was hoping the course was as flat and as even as it’s possible for a trail to be. (NB: There is absolutely no reason why I couldn’t have recced the course before the event and found out exactly how even/uneven it was, but I didn’t – big oversight on my part.)<br/><br/>There’s not much you can do about the weather and really it is part of the challenge. But this weekend the weather would be particularly challenging, because the forecast was “fricking boiling”.<br/><br/>These kinds of events are always more fun if you know some other people who are taking part, and I am lucky enough to be friends with Claire Smith (UK’s top female ultra-endurance athlete, 7th woman in the world to complete a Deca Ironman triathlon), who had done the race twice before. Claire would be using the race as training for a Quin Triathlon at the end of August, which in turn would be training for another Deca Triathlon in November (I’m not making this up). Claire is vastly experienced with ultra-distance racing, and her help with pacing would be crucial towards the end of the race. Paul (a friend since school) was also running, but as he’d done a lot less training than me he had not set a target mileage and was just going to see how far he could go. Another good friend, Baljinder “B-Real” BoSingh, a Doctor of Emergency Medicine, would be crewing for me and making sure I didn’t die.<br/><br/>My parents dropped off Paul and I at the Solo Competitor camping ground and we put up Paul’s mega tent. Hopefully we wouldn’t need it, but it’s good to have somewhere to stash all the gear and get out of the elements if required. B-Real arrived around 10:00am and Claire turned up soon after. B-Real told us how little sleep he’d had over the past few days, working long shifts in A&amp;E and looking after his 1-year-old son who was determined to stay awake. As is always the case with me and racing, my brain had decided that I didn’t need any sleep either, and had kept me awake the entire night. Obviously, staying awake for 24 hours is not enough of a challenge, let’s make it 48. Thanks a lot, brain.<br/><br/>The race started on time and off we went, lap number 1. My plan was to try and get the first 50 miles (9 laps) completed in 10 hours. This would leave me with 6 hours for the next 25 miles and 8 hours for the final 25. The first lap would tell me if my plan was going to work or not. <br/><br/>The whole course is very scenic, but I quickly found that with my wobbly ankle I would not be able to run a lot of it. The first 3km go through woods and around fields, but the surface was pretty uneven: stones, roots, lumps and bumps. Then a runnable section of dirt road up to the first aid station, at the top of the ornamental drive looking down towards Cirencester Parish Church tower. The ornamental drive is a smooth tarmac surface that slopes downhill, but in some places too steep to run, especially if I want to make my legs last 100 miles. At the bottom of the drive there is another tarmac section just past 5km that can be run… until it turns steeply uphill, and it’s back to walking for another 100 metres or so. Although the road still slopes up hill, it’s possible to run up to about 6.5km before the course turns off into a field. After that it’s a rough-but-runnable section of single track to approximately 7.5km, then approximately 500 metres through a field before the route turns back on to a broken single-track road. Kilometre 8 to the finish is runnable.<br/><br/>The first lap took just over 51 minutes which was on pace for the target of 50 miles in the first 10 hours, but I was slightly concerned about the sections I had ran on that lap which I knew I would not be able to run on future laps. My other concern was the intense heat; the aid stations only supplied water, and I would need to be consuming a lot of electrolytes to replace those lost through sweating. I had planned on carrying 400ml of electrolyte drink per lap, filling my bottle at the half-way point with water, then topping up with electrolytes at the end of each lap which B-Real was mixing up for me. I had drunk all my electrolytes in the first 3km and was feeling pretty thirsty before I even got to the aid station just short of 4km. After a couple of laps, I told B-Real to double the strength of the electrolyte mix and give me two 600ml bottles to carry. I was now drinking over 2 litres of fluid per hour, I was bathed in sweat, and it felt like it was getting hotter. <br/><br/>I had bought a lot of food for the event, but I quickly found the only solid food I could eat was half a banana each lap. I took a “lemon meringue flavoured” gel (they don’t taste like any lemon meringue pie I’ve ever eaten, but I could at least keep them down) each lap at the halfway point. Apart from not wanting to eat, I wasn’t feeling too bad. <br/><br/>By lap 5 I had established a pretty consistent run/walk strategy, and with one marathon completed I was cautiously optimistic about my 50 miles in 10 hours target. It was still very hot, but my legs were feeling ok.<br/><br/>I stopped to do a blister check after 7 laps (just after 7:00pm) and found that my feet were black with dirt. I washed my feet and, in the process, found a blister on my big toe. I drained the blister and wrapped the toe in surgical tape, put on some fresh socks and consulted B-Real on the next issue that was slightly concerning me; even though I was drinking gallons, I hadn’t needed to pee. I was sweating freely and showing no signs of dehydration or cramping, but even so…. we made a note to monitor the pee situation.<br/><br/>The sun started to go down on lap 8. Although running would be harder once it got dark, at least it would be cooler. I picked up a t-shirt and headtorch from B-Real at the end of the lap and set off again. By 10:00pm I had covered 50 miles, but I’d also drank over 20 litres of fluid and still hadn’t needed to pee. Although I felt more-or-less fine, was there something wrong with my kidneys? Could I really have lost 20 litres of water through sweating alone? Sometime after 11:30pm normal service was resumed and I was rewarded with a new tune to sing in my head for the next few laps. The song was “I can see clearly now the rain has gone”, but the lyrics had morphed into “I can pee clearly now the sun has gone, I pee on all obstacles in my way”. To my sleep deprived, banana-and-gel fuelled brain this was hilarious, and I felt surprisingly good for the next couple of laps.<br/><br/>By lap 12 my legs were pretty sore and I was having trouble bending them. Although I could still run, the difference in speed between running and walking was negligible. By now every step hurt, but running hurt the most so it made sense to try and walk as fast as possible and hope that I still had enough in my legs to make up time at the end. I started calculating times in my head for each kilometre, each lap, how much time there was left… if I kept walking at my current pace, I wouldn’t complete 100 miles within the 24-hour cut off. Even though it would hurt, I knew I could still run - but I didn’t know how long I’d be able to keep it up, so I’d have to save my legs until the end. The last few laps were going to be as much about pain management as they would be about running.<br/><br/>At some point during the night I started to get cold, so stopped for more layers, a woolly hat, and to treat a few more blisters. I use Topo Athletic running shoes, the best shoes I’ve ever ran in. I had been completely blister-free in training, but the problem with running 100 miles is that the feet you start with are not the feet you finish with. A combination of dirt, sweat, swollen feet, uneven surfaces and the general attrition of taking thousands and thousands of steps were taking their toll. Needles, surgical tape and anti-septic gel would get me back on course, as long as I had B-Real to help me stand up again after I’d sat down. <br/><br/>The sun came up at the start of lap 15. I’d hoped to complete as many laps as possible before the heat picked up again. 80 miles done, 20 to go, and I now need to make up some time. Despite my sore feet I stomped around lap 16, knowing that Claire would help with the pacing on the penultimate lap. We started lap 17 with 3 hours and 3 minutes until cut off. I told Claire I needed to finish this lap in 1 hour 30 minutes to have enough time for lap 18. We completed the lap in 1 hour 30 minutes and 10 seconds. I have no idea how she does that.<br/><br/>For the final lap I was joined by Dr B-Real, who was clearly pleased to be moving again, having spent most of the past 23 hours standing around looking out for me. Unfortunately I had to apologise that I wouldn’t really be able to talk much, as all my concentration would be taken up with placing every step as carefully as possible to limit the risk of a trip/stumble/strain that could end my race, and managing the pain in my legs and feet. B-Real was great, carrying my bottles and keeping me topped up with food and drink, and could easily match my pace; 90+ miles certainly takes it out of you. We made the turn at the bottom of the ornamental drive in front of Cirencester Parish Church tower and ran to the 5km marker. I was surprised that my legs responded pretty well, and it actually felt like I was running with my own legs rather than legs I’d borrowed off someone else who had left them in a shed for a few years. <br/><br/>Some more walking on the steep part of the hill, then back to running. Once again, I was surprised that I could actually run – it hurt, but it wasn’t unbearable. I put my head down and kept going until 6.5km. I had been checking time/pace for each kilometre, but probably due to sleep deprivation and not being very good at maths, I’d calculated that I only had a minute in hand (we needed to cover each kilometre in exactly 10 minutes, but I had added an extra 10 minutes for kilometre 9… which is the finish, so clearly I didn’t need to run an extra kilometre after that). I kept an eye on the watch and ran all the runnable sections. By 8km I’d stopped looking. There was nothing for it now but to run.<br/><br/>I entered the finishing straight and crossed the line in a time of 23:48:05, having covered a total of 100.6 miles. Only in the last few hundred meters did I realise that I actually had almost 12 minutes spare, rather than the 2 minutes I thought I had. Still, none of that mattered once I’d crossed the finish line – hugs all round, and a question answered: yes, I can run 100 miles in under 24 hours… just.<br/><br/><b>Huge thanks:</b></p><p><span>B-Real, Claire Swear, The A Man, Dr Banner and The HULK, and of course Ma &amp; Pa Dales, for all the support. </span><span>Everyone involved in organising, marshalling and every other aspect of running the Cotswold 24 Hour Race.

It is important to us that they are a part of our day and so we asked them to pick a charity that meant something to them. Grandad picked Sightsavers straight away. He couldn't believe, that for so little money, children all over the world could have their vision returned and yet so many were still left blind and vulnerable. He had already donated to this cause himself.</p><p>13 days after grandad picked this charity for us, on 13th July 2018, he passed away surrounded by many people that loved him.

I realised how lucky I was to have the choice and money to just make a decision and go to have the treatment unlike many others who have to live with their vision impairment.</span></p><p><span>When I read about A Million Miracles I felt the need to help as much as I could. Sightsavers work is very inspiring.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>My Coast to Coast walk was an organised group that I joined with my friend Elizabeth. There were 14 of us in all and we soon became very good friends spending 14 days walking and chatting about anything and everything to while away the long hours across the Lake District, Yorkshire Dales and North York Moors. It was during these chats that 2 people, separate of each other suggested I take up running. I poo pooed them and said I had never even run across the road for a bus and there was no way I could go running but it stuck with me and I kept thinking about it.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>When I got home I felt physically and mentally strong after walking 192 miles even though my feet felt like horse’s hooves.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>I decided not to let the strength disappear and so I downloaded the app, Couch to 5K, and tentatively started the first 1 minute run that nearly killed me. Soon I was running a bit more every week and eventually I reached the 5K (30 minutes) and I cried. Not from pain but from the sense of achievement.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>I quickly decided to down load the app 5k-10k and set off to double my distance over a period of months. Eventually cracking the 10K distance.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>At this point I didn’t know if I should continue as I was worried I was too old and would destroy my knees. But my sensible head went out of the window as I downloaded the app 10K-21K and started to work towards the half marathon. I live in Ealing and there is a very good half marathon every year in September which goes right past the front of my house. I usually go out every year to clap the runners past, never dreaming that I would ever be able to do such a thing. (As of September 24th 2017 I have now completed that half marathon in 2 hours and 8 minutes and am very happy with that time for my first effort.)</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>I then received an email from Margaret (one of the ladies who was on the coast to Coast walk) to say that her friend Karen was going to be running in the London Marathon in April 2017 for charity and would we consider sponsoring her. Karen was very special to us, she was not just any old friend of Margaret, she went out of her way to drive across the UK with a box of homemade chocolate brownies and a bottle of fizz for us all on our last day. She met us in a small village about 2 hours walk from Robin Hood’s Bay (our final destination) with the brownies to share out amongst us to give us all a chocolate boost and then drove on to Robin Hood’s Bay with the fizz and shared it all out with a glass for each of us to celebrate our wonderful achievement as we dipped our toes in the water. What a wonderful friend.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>Of course, I sponsored Karen, after all, one good turn deserves another even after one and a half years had gone by. I then spent all of Sunday morning trying to spot her on TV in the marathon. It was at this point that I decided I could do this. I could run that marathon too as I watched everyone running the course. So here I am with a place and am absolutely </span>petrified<span>, what have I done? But I WILL do this and hope to raise a good sum for Sightsavers and all those eyesights that will be restored to people who have lost hope.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>I hated sports at school and was always useless. Sports day was my biggest nightmare as I ran around hurdles and under the high jump and would hide in the toilets. Who would think that in my 60th year I would attempt to do such a thing as run the London marathon? I wish my teachers could see me now.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>Last year I ran in my first ever race, the Osterley 10K. it was 26 degrees that morning but I completed it in literally seconds over the hour and I was the proud owner of my first ever running medal. (I went to bed in it that night and woke up with the medal part under my armpit ) I have since hung it up to remind me of what i can achieve when I decide to do something. My Ealing Half marathon was run in 20 degrees and full sunshine but I completed it and now have a second medal which I also wore to bed that night!! I can feel a tradition starting here.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>At the beginning of February I also completed, with a personal best of 57 minutes, the London Winter 10k run with 20,000 other people, starting in Trafalgar Square and running basically to St Paul's and back round the streets of London. It was freezing cold but so much fun and honestly, I felt like I would have liked to turn round and do it all again when I got to the end. I wanted to experience what it was like to run with so many people in London before the big MARATHON day.</span></p><p class=""p1""><span>I have now completed the hottest London marathon on record, 24.1 degrees officially, in a time I am really chuffed with, 4:59:17, a fraction under the 5 hour mark. It was challenging and hot but I was well trained (I had run 419 miles during the previous 5 months), well fuelled thanks to my lovely Craig and well hydrated due to no alcohol at all for at least a month before. I felt strong and determined and when it got tough around 23-24 miles I gave myself a good talking to and ran on to get over the line in just under the 5 hours which was my aim. </span></p><p class=""p1""><span>I love my medal, its heavy and bears all the weight of the effort involved to obtain it. I will never forget that day for the rest of my life, I ran with a massive smile most of the way. Apologies in advance if you still see me wearing my medal now and again but I am chuffed to bits with it :)</span></p><p class=""p1"">I am now an official marathoner at the age of 59 and a half!!! xxx</p><p class=""p1""><span>I wrote a blog about my Coast to Coast walk if you want to read about my effort.

I was fortunate to grow up with optional extras to make life easier; clip-on sunglasses (I was cool), prescription swimming goggles, then contact lenses and even some creative Dad-inventions (old lenses stuck inside a snorkelling mask). A few months ago I went one better and benefitted from the incredible technology of Laser Eye Surgery. Within 3 days I was deemed legal to drive without visual aid (pretty hard to comprehend when you've lived through -8.5).<br/><br/>Wearing glasses wasn't an issue (unsurprisingly I was used to it), but I always felt vulnerable to any situation in which they could be ripped away. In an emergency my confidence and independence would instantly be gone.

These did not phase her up until December 2016 when she was experiencing severe headaches and blurry vision and we were told that the cancer had metastasised</span><span> into her brain which is extremely rare for her form and that it was applying pressure to her eyes, thus distorting her vision. She underwent radiotherapy which was unsuccessful and we were not able to contain the tumour within her. It continued to </span><span>colonise</span><span> her brain and eventually it grew on her optic nerves and she effectively lost her vision. </span></p><p><span>Mariyah had endured every side effect and possible manifestation of pain but it did not defeat her, however when she lost her eyesight, she was </span><span>absolutely</span><span> </span><span>distraught. Her character had changed, her will wasted away and she began to lose herself and eventually so would we. For Mariyah, her vision was her connection to the outside world, even when she was cornered by the unstoppable forces of nature within her, it allowed her to see the comforting smile of her parents faces or even the photos that would evoke her favourite memories that would provide her with the hope and thus determination to fight; however when this connection was severed she was defeated as she entered the dark abyss of the end of her life. </span><br/></p><p><span>Sadly, she lost her battle on the 19th of April 2017. However, before she had passed she had heard about Sighsavers and their pledge to treat blind children and restore their vision by removing their cataracts. When she heard that it would only cost £4 per eye, she immediately wanted to contribute to restore the vision of as many children as she could as she was enraged that it could be done so easily</span><span>. Even though she knew that her vision could not be restored, she wanted to impact the lives of those that could be treated as she had endured </span>their pain. She wanted to add this extremely personal pledge to her portfolio of charitable work but unfortunately she was not able to do so. Therefore, we would like to carry out Mariyah's wish to pledge and continue her profound impact on this planet by giving the gift of sight. </p>",Fundraising in loving memory of Mariyah Jasrai,1652.50,0,11003,110,0,I am fundraising because I would like to restore the eyesight of 2500 kids.,I am fundraising,I would like to restore the eyesight of 2500 kids.,443883,Mariyah Jasrai,/093f718c/v1/fundraising/pagebyid/9935335,remember/443883,Mariyah Jasrai,NA,NA,NA,NA,In memory of Mariyah Jasrai,https://www.justgiving.com/Sofian-Jasrai,/Sofian-Jasrai,United Kingdom,...<strong>Sightsavers</strong>...,Fundraising in loving memory of Mariyah Jasrai,//images.justgiving.com/image/ca556780-635e-476e-9cd9-1e00c1692d99.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,2.1190095,Sofian Jasrai,2017-04-26T22:04:24,179,4210958,2017-04-26T22:04:24,10000,12271,I am fundraising,I would like to restore the eyesight of 2500 kids.,Sightsavers,207544,2018-08-25T14:59:14Z

She gave to dozens of charities, worked in a charity shop for years, and organized the Red Cross charity flag sellers in her parish for 30 years, all unpaid and out of the goodness of her large heart. </p><p><span>But Sightsavers was especially close to that heart, the one cause above all others that she wanted to support. For her, blindness was the most terrible of afflictions, and Sightsavers' mission to eliminate avoidable blindness and to make the world a fairer place for people with such disabilities was something that deserved the widest possible support.</span><br/></p><p>And while she loved flowers, she always thought it wrong that money would be lavished on flowers for a funeral (which wouldn't benefit the deceased), when it could be spent to much better effect and benefit far more by being given to a good cause such as Sightsavers.<br/><br/>Phoebe was not a great one for computers, always preferring handwritten letters, phone calls and face-to-face contact, but she diligently attended a computer class for years, learning (just about) how to read and write emails. She was a great pragmatist, however, and she did accept that, even if it was all gobbledygook to her, the internet could be harnessed for good purposes. Hence this page – and the comparable one for her late, much missed husband Dick (https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/richardwoollcombe) in aid of the Alzheimer's Society – had her blessing, in the hopes that it would help her precious cause of Sightsavers. </p><p>So, whether you knew Phoebe and want to give something in her memory, or whether you think Sightsavers is an admirable cause and deserves support, thank you for whatever you can give.</p><p>PS  Why is this page called Phoebe's Online Egg Round? Simple: as anyone who lived near her will know, once a week she would go round the local village selling eggs from her hens to friends and neighbours. She always called this her egg round, and it became very much a social event, with her driving home full to the gills after 15 cups of tea and endless chat. She also milked it for all she was worth when she was selling flags for the Red Cross. This page is very much in the same shameless spirit, hence the name!</p><p><span>Finally, here's the official blurb:</span></p><p><span>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

A staggering 16,000 children under the age of five die from diseases that are easy to prevent. <br/></div><div style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">Water and sanitation-related diseases such as diarrhoea are one of the biggest causes of death for children under five around the world. Poor sanitation, water and hygiene affect more than just children's health. Children - particularly girls - often miss out on education because schools lack proper toilets and hand-washing facilities. Others miss out because they have to spend their days making long journeys to collect clean water rather than going to school. Deadly diseases like measles, polio, tetanus, tuberculosis and diphtheria are all easily and cheaply preventable by vaccination. Yet children still die because they simply don't get the healthcare and life-saving vaccines they need. <br/></div><div style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">UNICEF provides vaccines to immunise almost half the world's children against preventable diseases. They also have water, sanitation and hygiene teams working in more than 100 countries, keeping children safe by providing better water supplies and sanitation facilities in schools and communities. However there is still so much more that can be done to help, which is why we at Surrey UNICEF on Campus have decided to focus on this issue for the upcoming semester. We hope we can count on your support to make a difference! </div><div style=""background-color: transparent;color: rgb(49, 49, 49);text-align: left;""><br/></div></div><!--EndFragment-->",Clean Water and Vaccines Campaign,0,141.81,30,115,0,Surrey UNICEF on Campus,Surrey UNICEF on Campus,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,surrey-unicef,NA,NA,NA,Clean Water and Vaccines,https://www.justgiving.com/Surrey-Unicef-Clean-Water-And-Vaccines,/Surrey-Unicef-Clean-Water-And-Vaccines,United Kingdom,...Surrey <strong>UNICEF</strong> on Campus...,Clean Water and Vaccines Campaign,//images.justgiving.com/image/5ab422c0-4753-4c63-906f-fc1237763eee.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true,Fundraiser,12.991395,Surrey Unicef On Campus Society,2018-02-07T20:59:14,181813,4636868,2018-02-07T20:59:14,150,183895,Surrey UNICEF on Campus,NA,Unicef UK,1072612,2018-08-25T14:59:14Z

I am Truely Blessed not only because I live in a country where we have clean running water and help when needed to provide food for our family's but also where we have got a health care system that enables us to get medications to prevent or treat or suppress desies. Could you imagine living without these life line's on a daily basis? Could you imagine your children , grandchildren,  nieces or nephews waking up every day with no one to care for them starving and having slow painful deaths? Neither could I. Please Please help us raise as much money as possible to get the much deserved help these poor defenceless children so Desperatly Need. </p><p>Me and Daniel are going to be doing our fast on my birthday 15th June so there will be no cake or chocolates for me but if it means our friends and family's will get behind us and help us raise as much finds as possible then it's a tiny price to pay. </p><p>Please help us to make a difference lets show we do care not just for yourself and family and friends but about humans in general.

ANOTHER fundraising page, for ANOTHER idiot embarking on ANOTHER stupid challenge that really is only going to give this idiot reasons to post &#34;healthy me&#34; pictures and stories and raise her Instagram profile&#34;</p><p>So, firstly, only takes a glance at my Instagram content to understand that &#34;healthy&#34; posts aren't really my thing. If the Portman group had a say in the livelihood of Instagram accounts, my profile would be shut down faster that you can say &#34;dirty martini&#34;</p><p>Secondly, there is a reason why these fundraising pages keep popping up on our news feeds, and I'd like to think that the reason is not solely to help idiots like me entering genuinely life threatening challenges, but that in the light of recent social, economic and environmental disasters we all feel a little more responsible for each other, a little less selfish and a little more conscious of our duty as...well, simply...humans.</p><p>There is no better charity, there are no hierarchy or inequality in kindness and generosity, all causes are worth fighting for. But, those who know me, know that the refugees and immigration conundrum has always been very close to my heart. I believe, this is the one common trait to all humans, wherever we are from or live we really all come from somewhere else. 1st, 2nd, 3rd generation, we are all migrants in one way or another, and it's likely we will be migrants again. It is therefore our duty to care for this issue that, really, is almost as old as the world itself.</p><p>This is why I am extremely proud to take on the challenge of finishing the London marathon to raise money for Unicef. Unicef is doing an amazing job in fighting on all fronts for children all over the world, and one program that has (sadly) taken a lot of their resources in the past  few years is the issue of unaccompanied children in Europe. There are more child refugees in Europe than at any point since the end of the second world war. As children flee from war and disaster, borders across Europe are closing and making their journeys even more dangerous and difficult. Unicef has established support hubs across Europe to provide help to refugee children and families. Your donation will help save children from diseases or starvation and will help reuniting families.</p><p>So all this blabbering really to say one thing : DONATE PLEASE, there are NO small donation. And if my monologue didn't really move you (I mean, first I can show you the way to the nearest heart store because CLEARLY YOU WERE BORN WITHOUT A HEART  *dramatically exits and slams the door*).... PLEASE donate for the sole purpose of buying yourself the right to comment on the too many drinks I will surely be having way to close to race day....because &#34;self control&#34; is my middle name and I like to make a challenge even more of a challenge :)</p><p>That's it y'all !

My application to run in the 2019 Virgin Money London Marathon has been accepted.<br/>This means that (somehow) on the 28th April 2019, I will be running the 26-mile marathon (…nearly twice the length of Malta!?) for my charity sponsor, UNICEF.</p><p><u>Why UNICEF?</u></p><p>Every day, young children face violence, disease and hunger.<br/>They are battered by the chaos of war and natural disaster and forced to flee their homes.</p><p>UNICEF ensures more of the world’s children are vaccinated, educated and protected than any other organisation. </p><p>Today, thousands of children will die from diseases that are<br/>easy to prevent. Thousands more will die because they don’t have the food they need to live and grow. And yet more will experience unspeakable violence.</p><p>UNICEF keeps children safe by providing vaccines against deadly diseases and by promoting safe hygiene in communities around the world. They are the world’s largest supplier of emergency life-saving food for children, and campaign tirelessly to end violence against children.</p><p>I have been fortunate enough to lead a healthy life, been provided with a good education and live in a safe environment, unlike many other children who are forced to live in the chaos of war and poverty. For all<br/>these reasons, this is why I will be running for team UNICEF.<span>  </span></p><p>I will be able to help them continue their vital work for children around the world. My £2,000 in sponsorship could protect over 16,000<br/>children from the crippling effects of polio.</p><p>Another reason why I’ve chosen UNICEF is because my late grandfather worked closely with humanitarian services and aided in various charitable work, and I promised myself I would follow in his footsteps.</p><p>By helping UNICEF just a little, they can keep providing essential global humanitarian work that in today’s world is increasingly important – so hopefully this is a good start!</p><p>I appreciate all donations received, my aim is to raise <u>a minimum of</u> <u>£2,000 by April 2019, 50% of which must be raised before end of<br/>2018.</u></p><p>Thank you so much for taking the time to read and, at the same time; aiding to raise awareness and understanding. </p><p>Stan</p><p></p>",Stan's Unicef-London Marathon 2019 Fundraiser,43.75,0,435,22,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,London Marathon 2019,https://www.justgiving.com/Stan-Deborggraeve,/Stan-Deborggraeve,United Kingdom,...Stan's <strong>Unicef</strong>-London Marathon 2019 Fundraiser...,Stan's Unicef-London Marathon 2019 Fundraiser,//images.justgiving.com/image/trainer-no-branding_web.jpg?template=size120x120&imagetype=frpphoto&trymigrate=true&sourcepath=Stock,Fundraiser,3.9879334,Stan  Deborggraeve,2018-08-13T15:04:39,181813,4606054,2019-04-28T00:00:00,2000,183895,NA,NA,Unicef UK,1072612,2018-08-25T14:59:14Z

I am somewhat limited by precarious health so a fun run was not an option but the long days confined to bed had nurtured an affection for film and television.  So if you're going to do something stick to what you know.</p><p>Supported by my wife and children, we started by approaching some celebrity actor friends and asking that they sign photographs that could then be sold/auctioned to raise funds. This gradually progressed and we are now very proud to have the kind support of some special individuals as patrons of our group; much loved actors Dave Prowse M.B.E. and Kenneth Cope , writer/broadcaster Richard Hope-Hawkins and showbiz author Graham McCann.  The late Richard Briers C.B.E. was also a supportive patron and a dear friend.  His passing was a deep loss to our cause but also a personal sadness.</p><p>Most of our fundraising is via photographs which have been signed by stars of film and television which are then sold at special events and auctioned online. Past events include being part of a Star Wars themed weekend at Spaceport in Wallasey and a Craft &amp; Memorabilia fair with Kenneth Cope working very hard to make the day a success.</p><p>This page was created at the suggestion of UNICEF UK to provide some background to our fundraising mission.

different charities, and one of them, is UNICEF. UNICEF try to save children in other countries from being on the street and and try to stop them getting hurt when countries are at war. If you donate, it would be saving a child's life. Donating with JustGiving is easy and
 safe, I have donated to charities through JustGiving before and so have
 lots of people I know, so take it from me. It's safe. If you can't 
donate for some reason, you can always help by sharing this page, 
sharing my videos on YouTube, or sharing my Twitch page. This will be 
one of 5 charities I will focus my streaming on, and each week a charity
 will be chosen to be more focused on that week, but you can always

I drool over smartphones, smartwatches, smartmetres, games consoles, sound systems... We're living in the future, and I love it. <br /><br />But, being permanently connected has consequences, and not all of them are good. I've noticed that having an infinite world of entertainment at my fingertips makes me feel anxious, like there's too much to consume and not enough time. Being permanently contactable means that the challenges of work follow me home, and the challenges of home follow me to work. Having 500 friends online makes it easier to forget about the half-dozen friends and loved ones who actually know me. And, having constant background noise means that I've become uncomfortable with silence, and I believe that God is revealed in silence.<br /><br />In other words, the internet can impair my sense of gratitude for how lucky I am. I'm conscious that there are currently innumerable children who have been displaced by war and violence, and that simply having a roof over my head places me in a position of privilege. <br /><br />So, in terms of virtual reality, I'm going to go into the desert for a while. I've unplugged my router, put it away, and I'm not going to plug it back in for 90 days - until the 20th July.

My name is Shirley and I'm a 23 year old girl from London! In October of this year I took a trip to Ghana with my mum, to visit family, as we hadn't been back there in so long! It's such a wonderful place and I enjoyed my time there! But during my last few days, I contracted Malaria. It sort of crept up on me as I didn't even come across any mosquito bites, and I was taking anti-malarial tablets. I remember sitting with my family at an event, and feeling a little ill, and so I excused myself to the restroom, and I guess that's when the symptoms started. I was sick and felt so weak. When I explained this to my mum, and told her that I felt feverish (hot one minute, cold the next), she immediatly took me to the hospital. I saw the doctor and took some tests, and the results came back positive for malaria. I remember thinking, why me? Lucky for me, my mum was quick to make the decision to take me to the doctor. I recieved a few injections and medicine, and was told to finish the course of medicine over the following days. I was due to travel back to the UK that same day, and even though I was dreading the long plane ride, I just wanted to be home. It wasn't a pleasant journey as I cried half of the time, but when I got home, my mum put me in bed, and I was comfortable enough to rest. I was in bed for a whole week, but thankfully I recovered fully after that.</p>
<p>I can say that I am very fortunate to have been through that and recover, as some people aren't as lucky.</p>
<p>Malaria is a serious but preventable and treatable disease, but it claims the life of a child every minute. However, serious malaria cases can be reduced by providing mosquito nets, tests and medicines.</p>
<p>That's where a charity like Malaria No More UK comes in. I came across them and was very impressed with the work that they do to help people who may not have access to treatment or preventable measures for Malaria.</p>
<p>So I wanted to raise as much money as I could, with the help of my friends on the internet, to donate to their cause. If you're here reading this, thank you for visiting this page. And if you feel compelled to give, even as little as £1, I know that it would go a long way, and eventually help those people in need.</p>

very much enjoyed meeting you in Cardiff for Act 5 of the Extreme Sailing
Series 2014. <br>
<br>
Thank you for taking the time to donate to WaterAid.<br>
<br>
WaterAid is an international development organisation with a vision of a world
where everyone, everywhere has access to safe water and sanitation. We work in
26 countries across Africa, Asia, Central America and the Pacific Region to
transform lives in some of the world’s poorest communities.<br>
<br>
Since 1981, we have reached 21 million people with safe water and, since 2004,
18 million people with improved sanitation. In 2011, WaterAid became J.P
Morgan’s charity partner through the GeneroCITY employee engagement campaign.
In 2013, we also became the official beneficiary of J.P Morgan’s Corporate
Challenge in London.<br>
<br>
J.P Morgan’s staff <span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span>have raised an
incredible £230,000 so far and we thank them for the fantastic ongoing efforts

<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=""Default""><span style=""font-size:11.5pt"">Being a girl means something
different to all of us. Perhaps it means to be happy, determined, carefree,
feisty or particular? But for millions of girls around the world, to be a girl
means something very, very different. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=""Default""><span style=""font-size:11.5pt"">To be a girl without access to
clean, safe water means your role of collecting water can stop you from going
to school. It means back-breaking walks carrying heavy containers - often several
times a day. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=""Default""><span style=""font-size:11.5pt"">To be a girl without access to
a toilet means there’s nowhere private to go to the loo and going in the open
leaves you vulnerable to prying eyes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=""Default""><span style=""font-size:11.5pt"">To be a girl living without
access to safe water and toilets means displaying incredible physical and
emotional strength, day after day. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=""Default""><span style=""font-size: 11.5pt;"">But it&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">doesn't</span><span style=""font-size: 11.5pt;"">&nbsp;have to be this

<p>I have decided that one of my New Years resolutions is to give up my greatest love in order to raise money for charity...CRISPS. As most of you know, scoffing 3 packets of crisps a day and making nachos for one is my idea of living the dream. But now I've decided to give them up to raise money for <strong>WaterAid.</strong></p>
<p>Here's the WaterAid website so you can have a look and see where your donations will be going :-) <a href=""http://www.wateraid.org/uk"">http://www.wateraid.org/uk</a></p>
<p>Going to leave the page open for the whole year, any size donation will be massively appreciated!!</p>

Without all three, people can’t live dignified, healthy lives. With all three, they can unlock their potential, break free from poverty and change their lives for good. Children are born healthier and get the chance to go to school; women and men get to earn a living; and whole communities start to thrive. It sounds normal and it should be.</p><p>The Zambia Cycle trek will be physically demanding, with the group cycling 90km per day (on average) on off-road dirt tracks in the 30C heat. This is not simply a walk in the park, and nor should it be, yet the physical challenge will be well worth it to raise money for WaterAid.</p><p>Throughout the challenge the group will also be visiting two WaterAid projects in Zambia, which will give us a real opportunity to see how your money will be spent by WaterAid and how it can make such a difference to the lives of so many. For example, £15 buys enough cement to build a life-saving toilet for a community, £100 seven hygienic taps for a hospital and £1,000 a school sanitation block for 250 children.

I've continued training for this event, and whilst it hasn't got any easier (believe me - I sound as if I'm dying for the first 15 minutes!), on the 11th May<b> I managed to run 10k for the first time in my life!!</b>.  I've worked really hard to get myself ready for this race, and I would appreciate anything you can possibly spare, however little, in sponsorship, <span>very very much.  </span></p><p>As a group of flood risk professionals we have come together to run the Vitality London 10k, and in doing so raise money for an incredibly worthwhile charity; one which is close to our hearts, given the industry we all work in - Wateraid.  Even better, Thames Water have agreed to sponsor us as well, so we really hope to be able to make a worthwhile contribution to this important charity.  Water is vital to life, however it is so cheap and accessible in the UK, that we only ever think about it if there's too much or too little of it; but those events are thankfully rare.  We flush water down the toilet that is of fantastic quality; in a surprisingly large amount of the world, people can't even dream about having water of such quality to drink, let alone to flush away.  Your contributions can make a real difference.  Thank you.  </p><p>And now something from Wateraid.....</p><p>Clean water, decent toilets and good hygiene should be a normal part of everyone’s daily life.

Is it really such a hardship to have to boil drinking water or take a trip to the shops to buy bottled water?</p><p>Compare this to the 650 Million people around the world who live without safe drinking water.</p><p>2.3 Billion (that's one in three!) people do not have access to adequate sanitation.</p><p>500,000 children die every year from diarrohea, caused by unsafe drinking water. That's 1,400 deaths every day.</p><p>But it's also the other implications that affect these communities, the process of collecting water is so time consuming and exhausting they have little time or energy left for anything else. That's hours every day that could be spent much more productively. WaterAid also reports that many girls who are fortunate enough to attend school are forced to drop out when they begin to menstruate, this is purely due to the lack of basic sanitation.</p><p>United Utilities have promised to compensate every household and business affected. This compensation is estimated to be around £45.00 per customer, with the total bill expected to&nbsp;be about&nbsp;£15 million. If we can raise just a fraction of this it will save lives, transform communities and give children around the world a chance for a better future.</p><p>So I'm asking that, when you receive your compensation from United Utilities, you consider using a little to change or&nbsp;save a life and donate it to this cause.</p><p>Also, when all the money is in, I will be writing to Steve Mogford (the CEO of United Utilities)&nbsp;to&nbsp;ask that&nbsp;his company match our donation.</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to visit my JustGiving page.</p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

All money that I fundraise will go directly to WaterAid, and this money will be used to give villagers across the world the skills and tools to access water, by enabling them to build wells and extract water from the land. This money will go towards helping these people become sustainable by giving them the skills to work themselves, creating jobs and giving villages access to safe drinking water. </p><p>I want to do this because I think that safe water is one of the most basic human rights, and there are millions who still do not have access to it. Thousands of girls and women are neglected an education and work due to having to walk miles to collect water, and it's not necessarily clean water either. 900 children a day die from diarrhoeal diseases due to drinking dirty water - so I want to help get this statistic down by fundraising money to help others.</p><p>*** My hair will also be getting donated to the Little Princess Trust, that make wigs for little boys and girls that have sadly lost their hair due to cancer treatment ***</p><p>I hope that you can all support me as this is a massive leap from my last fundraising event, and it will ultimately help so many other people.</p><p>Donating through JustGiving is simple, fast and totally secure.

I saw children, women, frail men and women walking hours and hours in the dry heat just to get some water to drink, but the even sadder part is this was not even clean water it was dirty water.

She says it's impossible for her to wash her hands. The problem is made worse by the fact she doesn't have access to a toilet, meaning she has to go to the bushes even at night making it harder to stay safe and well and contaminating water further. </p><p><b>42 million people in ethopia do not have access to safe water. Only 20% have access to a toilet.

In addition to this when work is available it's difficult to work due to the many hours they have to walk just to access water (over 2 hours at the very least). </p><p>What really saddens me, is that diarrhoea is a preventable disease.

So, on 2nd September 2018, I will be jumping out of a plane at 15000ft - the highest point for skydiving in the UK.</span></p><p><span>All proceeds will go to WaterAid; a global organisation dedicated to reducing extreme poverty and saving lives by providing everyone, everywhere, with clean water and sanitation. (details about the charity follow the story below).</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><b><u>Why this is so important to me</u></b><br/></p><p><span>I love to write. Writing is my passion, my peace and my freedom. It usually comes so naturally and easily to me; it is not abnormal for me to write a poem with one hand whilst blow-drying my hair with the other, or to pen a whole chapter in a week of train journeys into work.</span></p><p><span>The relevance of that? Well it is now day 3 of pacing up and down my living room, the time is 3:21am and I still haven't found the right words for this story. Writing this is damn hard. Writing the paragraph above was a nice distraction. I have spent my entire life concealing my emotions and vulnerabilities behind confidence, vibrance and laughter. So believe me, the thought of sharing some of my heart with everyone I know is 100 percent more daunting than jumping out of that plane can ever be. </span></p><p><span>The truth is I didn't really know him.</span></p><p><span>My parents divorced when I was 8 years old, after which I, alongside my 3 elder siblings, was brought up single-handedly by my mum.<span>  </span>I won't delve into the circumstances surrounding the divorce. However, I will say that I was a child who, at that age, had witnessed more turbulence than most adults I know. I remember feeling emotions that children shouldn't.<span>  </span>I felt rage, anger towards my father, a deep sadness, worry, fear, anxiety, instability, insecurity. I could go on. </span></p><p><span>My Dad didn't keep in touch. For the rest of his life, until very near the end, he played no part in mine. I pretended I didn't care at all, but deep inside, I blamed him and hated him for everything.<span>  </span>I powered through my teenage years suffering with undiagnosed PTSD and depression, all the while performing well at school, both academically and socially. My Dad was never at the forefront of my mind - I didn't know what a father was to miss one. All I felt towards him was contempt, which, as the years rolled by, started to become indifference. </span></p><p><span>I was wrong. </span></p><p><span>Yes, I had every right to be angry. But I completely failed to comprehend my father's intricacies. I failed to understand his reasons, his demons, his own turbulent past, the state of his mind, the fact that he basically had no support system and was completely broken himself.<br/></span></p><p><span>I still try to tell myself that I couldn't possibly have known any better at such a young age. </span></p><p><span>Early in 2008, my eldest brother had started to try and rebuild a relationship with our father. By then, at the age of 20, I was becoming more mature and starting to realise some of the complexities above. I strongly considered joining my brother, but could never quite bring myself to go along. </span></p><p><span>In December 2008, my Dad was hospitalised with various health issues. At this point we all pulled together and spent time with him in the hospital. Unfortunately by the time I told him I was sorry, and that I would make it up to him, he had already lost his consciousness. I will never know whether or not he heard what I said that day.</span></p><p><span>On 23rd December 2008, my Dad lost his life.</span></p><p><span>The next few days, weeks, months, I felt numb. I couldn't grieve - how can you grieve for such an abstract relationship? I continued with my life as though nothing had happened, whilst in self-destruct mode, suffocating inside. </span></p><p><span>I felt wholly responsible for having never done anything to help my Dad. The pure, intense guilt was so overwhelming for such a prolonged period of time. It had a massive effect on both my physical and mental health. </span></p><p><span>I could barely process it, let alone talk about it. To this day I may have told this story to a small number of very close friends. I have never spoken about it with my siblings. I think it's just too painful for us all.</span></p><p><span>I am now 31 and I am stronger than I have ever been. I think now, be it 10 years too late, it's about time I acted on that promise I made to my Dad about making it up to him. What I am doing here is a first step, a small thing. My intention and commitment now, is to continue<span> </span>taking positive actions in his name for as long as I am able.</span></p><p><span>I have chosen WaterAid after much contemplation, as the work that they do provides sustainable, rather than one-off help, to people suffering extreme poverty. </span><span>This means that their projects affect </span><span>generation after generation, so each donation stretches further. Hopefully this </span><span>will also mean that my Dad will continue to receive prayers and blessings from people long after I have gone. </span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);float: none;"">1 in 3 people on the planet don't have a decent toilet of their own. 1 in 9 don't have clean water close to their home.

<p>CARE fights poverty and injustice in 86 countries around the world to help the world’s poorest people find routes out of poverty. CARE also delivers emergency aid to survivors of war and natural disasters, and helps people rebuild their lives in the aftermath.</p>
<p>CARE’s mission is to create lasting change in poor communities and put money where it is needed most: 94 pence in every £1 goes towards our poverty fighting programmes. That’s one of the highest rates among all the UK aid agencies.</p>
<p>We particularly like the work of Care International because its work ranges from providing education and shelter through to providing medicine- it is not restricted to one type of support. Additionally, it is not prejudiced in the type of people it helps; regardless of sex, race, gender, and religion it aims to help all those in extreme poverty.</p>
<p>We are particularly interested in the work that they are currently doing for Syrian refugees. The Syrian crisis is worsening day by day and I think its paramount that individuals and charities do all that they can to alleviate the suffering experienced. We also think that their work for one-off crisis' such as the Phillipines hurricane is significant; providing humanitarian aid quickly and efficiently for events such as these, is paramount to saving lives.</p>
<p>Your donations will go to those in need of education and to programmes helping small businesses, so communities can, in the long term, can get on their own feet. They will also go to those needing medication, water and shelter supplies so that in the short term suffering and poverty can be diminished. We also think that the way they work with businesses and Governments ensure that you donations definitely go to the right places.</p>
